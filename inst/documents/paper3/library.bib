abstract = {The evolution of resistance to pesticides and drugs by pests and pathogens is a textbook example of adaptation to environmental changes and a major issue in both public health and agronomy. Surprisingly, there is little consensus on how to combine selection pressures (i.e., molecules used in the treatment of pests or pathogens) over space and time to delay or prevent this evolutionary process. By reviewing theoretical models and experimental studies, we show that higher levels of heterogeneity of selection are associated with longer-term sustainability of pest or pathogen control. The combination of molecules usually outcompetes other resistance management strategies, such as Responsive alternation, Periodic application, or Mosaic, because it ensures 'multiple intragenerational killing'. A strategic deployment over space and/or time of several combinations can ensure 'multiple intergenerational killing', further delaying the evolution of resistance.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance threatens effective vector control, especially for mosquitoes and malaria. To manage resistance, recommended insecticide use strategies include mixtures, sequences and rotations. New insecticides are being developed and there is an opportunity to develop use strategies that limit the evolution of further resistance in the short term. A 2013 review of modelling and empirical studies of resistance points to the advantages of mixtures. However, there is limited recent, accessible modelling work addressing the evolution of resistance under different operational strategies. There is an opportunity to improve the level of mechanistic understanding within the operational community of how insecticide resistance can be expected to evolve in response to different strategies. This paper provides a concise, accessible description of a flexible model of the evolution of insecticide resistance. The model is used to develop a mechanistic picture of the evolution of insecticide resistance and how it is likely to respond to potential insecticide use strategies. The aim is to reach an audience unlikely to read a more detailed modelling paper. The model itself, as described here, represents two independent genes coding for resistance to two insecticides. This allows the representation of the use of insecticides in isolation, sequence and mixtures. The model is used to demonstrate the evolution of resistance under different scenarios and how this fits with intuitive reasoning about selection pressure. Using an insecticide in a mixture, relative to alone, always prompts slower evolution of resistance to that insecticide. However, when resistance to both insecticides is considered, resistance thresholds may be reached later for a sequence relative to a mixture. Increasing the ability of insecticides to kill susceptible mosquitoes (effectiveness), has the most influence on favouring a mixture over a sequence because one highly effective insecticide provides more protection to another in a mixture. The model offers an accessible description of the process of insecticide resistance evolution and how it is likely to respond to insecticide use. A simple online user-interface allowing further exploration is also provided. These tools can contribute to an improved discussion about operational decisions in insecticide resistance management.},

abstract = {Although theoretical studies have shown that the mixture strategy, which uses multiple toxins simultaneously, can effectively delay the evolution of insecticide resistance, whether it is the optimal management strategy under different insect life histories and insecticide types remains unknown. To test the robustness of this management strategy over different life histories, we developed a series of simulation models that cover almost all the diploid insect types and have the same basic structure describing pest population dynamics and resistance evolution with discrete time steps. For each of two insecticidal toxins, independent one-locus two-allele autosomal inheritance of resistance was assumed. The simulations demonstrated the optimality of the mixture strategy either when insecticide efficacy was incomplete or when some part of the population disperses between patches before mating. The rotation strategy, which uses one insecticide on one pest generation and a different one on the next, did not differ from sequential usage in the time to resistance, except when dominance was low. It was the optimal strategy when insecticide efficacy was high and premating selection and dispersal occur.},

@article{Kliot2012,
abstract = {Insects are exposed to a variety of stress factors in their environment, and, in many cases for insect pests to agriculture, those factors include toxic chemical insecticides. Coping with the toxicity of insecticides can be costly and requires energy and resource allocation for adaptation and survival. Several behavioural, physiological and genetic mechanisms are used by insects to handle toxic insecticides, sometimes leading to resistance by constitutive overexpression of detoxification enzymes or inducing mutations in the target sites. Such actions are costly and may affect reproduction, impair dispersal ability and have several other effects on the insect's fitness. Fitness costs resulting from resistance to insecticides has been reported in many insects from different orders, and several examples are given in this mini-review.},

ABSTRACT Dominance has been assessed in different ways in insecticide resistance studies, based on three phenotypic traits: the insecticide concentration required to give a particular mortality (D LC), mortality at a particular insecticide dose (D ML), and Þtness in treated areas (D WT). We propose a general formula for estimating dominance on a scale of 0 to 1 (0 ϭ complete recessivity and 1 ϭ complete dominance). D LC , D ML , and D WT are not directly related and their values depend on genetic background and environmental conditions. We also show that pest management strategies can have the consequence to increase D WT via the selection of dominance modiÞers. Studies on resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins provide the ultimate example of the complexity of the deÞnition of the concept of dominance. Almost all studies have focused on calculation of D LC , which provides little information about the efÞciency of pest management programs. For instance, one assumption of the high dose/refuge strategy is that Bacillus thuringiensis resistance must be effec-tively recessive (i.e., D ML must be close to zero). However, D WT , rather than D ML , is relevant to the resistance management strategy. Therefore, we strongly suggest that the time has come to focus on Þtness dominance levels in the presence and absence of insecticide.},
