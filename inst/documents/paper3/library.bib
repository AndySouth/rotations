abstract = {The evolution of resistance to pesticides and drugs by pests and pathogens is a textbook example of adaptation to environmental changes and a major issue in both public health and agronomy. Surprisingly, there is little consensus on how to combine selection pressures (i.e., molecules used in the treatment of pests or pathogens) over space and time to delay or prevent this evolutionary process. By reviewing theoretical models and experimental studies, we show that higher levels of heterogeneity of selection are associated with longer-term sustainability of pest or pathogen control. The combination of molecules usually outcompetes other resistance management strategies, such as Responsive alternation, Periodic application, or Mosaic, because it ensures 'multiple intragenerational killing'. A strategic deployment over space and/or time of several combinations can ensure 'multiple intergenerational killing', further delaying the evolution of resistance.},

@article{South2018,
abstract = {Insecticide resistance threatens effective vector control, especially for mosquitoes and malaria. To manage resistance, recommended insecticide use strategies include mixtures, sequences and rotations. New insecticides are being developed and there is an opportunity to develop use strategies that limit the evolution of further resistance in the short term. A 2013 review of modelling and empirical studies of resistance points to the advantages of mixtures. However, there is limited recent, accessible modelling work addressing the evolution of resistance under different operational strategies. There is an opportunity to improve the level of mechanistic understanding within the operational community of how insecticide resistance can be expected to evolve in response to different strategies. This paper provides a concise, accessible description of a flexible model of the evolution of insecticide resistance. The model is used to develop a mechanistic picture of the evolution of insecticide resistance and how it is likely to respond to potential insecticide use strategies. The aim is to reach an audience unlikely to read a more detailed modelling paper. The model itself, as described here, represents two independent genes coding for resistance to two insecticides. This allows the representation of the use of insecticides in isolation, sequence and mixtures. The model is used to demonstrate the evolution of resistance under different scenarios and how this fits with intuitive reasoning about selection pressure. Using an insecticide in a mixture, relative to alone, always prompts slower evolution of resistance to that insecticide. However, when resistance to both insecticides is considered, resistance thresholds may be reached later for a sequence relative to a mixture. Increasing the ability of insecticides to kill susceptible mosquitoes (effectiveness), has the most influence on favouring a mixture over a sequence because one highly effective insecticide provides more protection to another in a mixture. The model offers an accessible description of the process of insecticide resistance evolution and how it is likely to respond to insecticide use. A simple online user-interface allowing further exploration is also provided. These tools can contribute to an improved discussion about operational decisions in insecticide resistance management.},
