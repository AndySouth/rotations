abstract = {A big problem in malaria control is the rapidity with which mosquitoes can develop resistance to insecticides. The possibility of creating evolution-proof insecticides is therefore of considerable interest. Biologists have suggested that effective malaria control, with only weak selection for insecticide resistance, could be achieved if insecticides target only old mosquitoes that have already laid most of their eggs. The strategy aims to exploit the fact that most malarial mosquitoes do not live long enough to transmit the disease. We derive, analyse and compare two mathematical models, one for an insecticide that kills on exposure, and the other for an insecticide that targets only older mosquitoes. Both models predict that insecticide-resistant mosquitoes will become dominant over time but, very importantly, this occurs on a very much slower time scale when the insecticide only affects older mosquitoes. We present analytical results on linear and global stability of the non-trivial equilibrium in which only the resistant mosquito strain is present, together with a theorem comparing the rates of convergence for the two models. Numerical simulations show that the effect of targeting only old mosquitoes on the evolution of resistance is dramatic.},

The ubiquitous exposure of Anopheles mosquitoes to this chemistry has selected for resistance in a number of populations. This threatens the sustainability of our most effective interventions but no operationally practicable way of resolving the problem currently exists. One innovative solution involves the co-application of a powerful chemosterilant (pyriproxyfen or PPF) to bed nets that are usually treated only with pyrethroids. Resistant mosquitoes that are unaffected by the pyrethroid component of a PPF/pyrethroid co-treatment remain vulnerable to PPF. There is a differential impact of PPF on pyrethroid-resistant and susceptible mosquitoes that is modulated by the mosquito's behavioural response at co-treated surfaces. This imposes a specific fitness cost on pyrethroid-resistant phenotypes and can reverse selection. The concept is demonstrated using a mathematical model.},

The rapid development of genetically modulated resistance to insecticides is postulated to develop in two distinct ways: By selection for single major effect genes or by selection for loose confederations in which several factors, not normally associated with each other, inadvertently combine their effects to produce resistance phenotypes. Insecticide resistance is a common occurrence and has been intensively studied in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, providing a useful model for examining how insecticide resistance develops and what pleiotropic effects are likely to emerge as a consequence of resistance. As malaria vector control becomes increasingly reliant on successfully managing insecticide resistance, the characterisation of resistance mechanisms and their pleiotropic effects becomes increasingly important.},

This paper derives a method for choosing optimal pesticide strategies which takes these costs into account. It is found in the case of a multivoltine pest (given certain general genetic assumptions) that the available strategies can be reduced to a one-parameter set. The final choice which requires the quantification of resistance cost can thus be made graphically. The effect of resistance cost is found to be equivalent to an increase in the cost of pesticide. Finally some general rules are derived for the allocation of pesticide susceptibility (which may be treated as a depletable resource) between seasons having different numbers of pests. The case of the sugarcane froghopper is treated as an example of the method. {\textcopyright} 1977.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance is the major emerging challenge facing the malaria vector control programmes in Tanzania. Proper monitoring and detection is of paramount importance guiding the vector control programmes. This paper presents the effect of mosquito aging on insecticide resistance status in Anopheles arabiensis populations in dry and rainy seasons in northern Tanzania. 
                           Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae were sampled from rice fields in both dry and rainy seasons and reared in the insectary to adults. The emerged females in batches of 2, 3, 5, and 10 days old were exposed to six insecticides (deltamethrin, permethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, DDT, bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl) to see the effects of age on insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes were exposed to insecticides using WHO standard susceptibility test kits. Knockdown was recorded during the 1-h exposure, while mortality and resistance ratio were recorded 24 h later. Mosquito specimens were identified to species level using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Among the 326 specimens processed by PCR, 323 (99.1{\%}) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. There was reduced mortality (ranging from 61 to 97.7{\%}) when adults reared from larvae were exposed to all pyrethroids and bendiocarb in both dry and rainy seasons, while they were fully susceptible to DDT and pirimiphos-methyl. There was a significant increase in mortality rate with increase in mosquito's age in both dry and rainy seasons following exposure to pyrethroids (DF = 1, P {\textless} 0.05). Mosquitoes showed significantly higher mortality rates in the rainy season than in the dry season after being exposed to pyrethroids (DF = 1, P {\textless} 0.05). Higher mortality rates (94.0–99.8{\%}) were observed in all ages and seasons when mosquitoes were exposed to bendiocarb compared with pyrethroids. Pirimiphos-methyl was only tested in the rainy season so no comparison with dry season mosquitoes could be made. Results showed that An. arabiensis were resistant to pyrethroids in both seasons and that the young age groups exhibited higher levels of resistance compared with the older age groups. Mosquitoes were full susceptible to DDT and pirimiphos-methyl irrespective of the season and age.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The rapid selection of pyrethroid resistance throughout sub-Saharan Africa is a serious threat to malaria vector control. Chlorfenapyr is a pyrrole insecticide which shows no cross resistance to insecticide classes normally used for vector control and is effective on mosquito nets under experimental hut conditions. Unlike neurotoxic insecticides, chlorfenapyr owes its toxicity to disruption of metabolic pathways in mitochondria that enable cellular respiration. A series of experiments explored whether standard World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for evaluation of long-lasting insecticidal nets, developed through testing of pyrethroid insecticides, are suitable for evaluation of non-neurotoxic insecticides. METHODS The efficacy of WHO recommended cone, cylinder and tunnel tests was compared for pyrethroids and chlorfenapyr. To establish bioassay exposure times predictive of insecticide-treated net (ITN) efficacy in experimental hut trials, standard three-minute bioassays of pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr ITNs were compared with longer exposures. Mosquito behaviour and response to chlorfenapyr ITN in bioassays conducted at night were compared to day and across a range of temperatures representative of highland and lowland transmission. RESULTS Standard three-minute bioassay of chlorfenapyr produced extremely low levels of mortality compared to pyrethroids. Thirty-minute day-time bioassay produced mortality closer to hut efficacy of chlorfenapyr ITN but still fell short of the WHO threshold. Overnight tunnel test with chlorfenapyr produced 100{\%} mortality and exceeded the WHO threshold of 80{\%}. The endogenous circadian activity rhythm of anophelines results in inactivity by day and raised metabolism and flight activity by night. A model which explains improved toxicity of chlorfenapyr ITN when tested at night, and during the day at higher ambient temperature, is that activation of chlorfenapyr and disruption of respiratory pathways is enhanced when the insect is more metabolically and behaviourally active. CONCLUSIONS Testing according to current WHO guidelines is not suitable for certain types of non-neurotoxic insecticide which, although highly effective in field trials, would be overlooked at the screening stage of evaluation through bioassay. Testing methods must be tailored to the characteristics and mode of action of each insecticide class. The WHO tunnel test on night-active anophelines is the most reliable bioassay for identifying the toxicity of novel insecticides.},

abstract = {Mendelian crosses were used to analyze the patterns of inheritance of Cry-toxin resistance in two colonies of Culex quinquefasciatus Say larvae resistant to bacterial toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis de Barjac. Resistance levels exceeded 1000-fold at 95{\%} lethal concentration of the CryllAa-resistant colony (Cq11A). F1 offspring of reciprocal crosses to a susceptible colony revealed autosomal inheritance and offspring were intermediate in resistance to the susceptible and resistant parental lines. Dose-response tests on backcross offspring were consistent with polyfactorial inheritance of resistance toward CryllAa and Cry4Aa + Cry4Ba, whereas cross-resistance toward CryllBa best fit a monofactorial model. Resistance was 600-fold at 95{\%} lethal concentration in the colony selected with Cry4A + Cry4B (Cq4AB). Inheritance of resistance in F1 offspring was autosomal and intermediate to the susceptible and resistant parents. Inheritance of Cry4Aa + Cry4Ba and CryllBa resistance best fit a polyfactorial model in offspring of the Cq4AB backcross, whereas CryllAa-resistance inheritance fit a monofactorial model. Dominance values were calculated at different Cry-toxin concentrations for F, offspring of both resistant colonies; dominance generally decreased as treatment concentration increased. Resistance and cross-resistance remained stable in CqllA and Cq4AB in the absence of insecticide pressure. Allelic complementation tests were complementary and suggested that CqllA and Cq4AB evolved resistance to Cry toxins at common loci. The patterns of cross-resistance suggest cross-recognition of binding moieties by CryllAa, Cry4Aa + Cry4Ba, and CryllBa in these Culex, which may be partly responsible for the toxin synergy characteristic of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis de Barjac.},

Previous economic work on insecticide resistance illustrates the policy relevance of knowing whether insecticide resistance mutations involve fitness costs. Using a theoretical model, this article investigates economically optimal strategies for controlling malaria-transmitting mosquitoes when there is the potential for mosquitoes to evolve resistance to insecticides. Consistent with previous literature, we find that fitness costs are a key element in the computation of economically optimal resistance management strategies. Additionally, our models indicate that different biological mechanisms underlying these fitness costs (e.g., increased adult mortality and/or decreased fecundity) can significantly alter economically optimal resistance management strategies.},

The benefits of this method would be lost if resistance to the toxins spread to a significant proportion of the pest population. The primary resistance management method, mandatory in the United States, is the high-dose/ refuge strategy, requiring toxin-free crops as refuges near the insecticidal crops, and the use of toxin doses sufficiently high to kill insects heterozygous for a resistance allele, thereby rendering resistance functionally recessive. We propose that mass-release of harmless susceptible (toxin-sensitive) insects could substantially delay or even reverse the spread of resistance. Mass-release of such insects is an integral part of release of insects carrying a dominant lethal (RIDL), a method of pest control related to the sterile insect technique. We show by mathematical modeling that specific RIDL strategies could form an effective component of a resistance management strategy for plant-incorporated protectants and other toxins.},

abstract = {Malaria control programs rely on chemical insecticides to target mosquito vectors and are potentially threatened by the emergence of insecticide resistance in African vector populations. Insecticide resistance management initiatives require comprehensive quantification of resistance in field populations to the set of insecticides used in vector control. We analyzed patterns of variation and covariation in resistance to these insecticides, using statistical methods that handle the sparse spatiotemporal distribution of the available data. We found relationships across different insecticide types that are consistent across large parts of Africa, allowing prediction of resistance to be improved by incorporating observations across multiple insecticide types. We also found large-scale relationships between phenotypic resistance and patterns of genetic variation, demonstrating the potential utility of genetic markers.

The development of insecticide resistance in African malaria vectors threatens the continued efficacy of important vector control methods that rely on a limited set of insecticides. To understand the operational significance of resistance we require quantitative information about levels of resistance in field populations to the suite of vector control insecticides. Estimation of resistance is complicated by the sparsity of observations in field populations, variation in resistance over time and space at local and regional scales, and cross-resistance between different insecticide types. Using observations of the prevalence of resistance in mosquito species from the Anopheles gambiae complex sampled from 1,183 locations throughout Africa, we applied Bayesian geostatistical models to quantify patterns of covariation in resistance phenotypes across different insecticides. For resistance to the three pyrethroids tested, deltamethrin, permethrin, and $\lambda$-cyhalothrin, we found consistent forms of covariation across sub-Saharan Africa and covariation between resistance to these pyrethroids and resistance to DDT. We found no evidence of resistance interactions between carbamate and organophosphate insecticides or between these insecticides and those from other classes. For pyrethroids and DDT we found significant associations between predicted mean resistance and the observed frequency of kdr mutations in the Vgsc gene in field mosquito samples, with DDT showing the strongest association. These results improve our capacity to understand and predict resistance patterns throughout Africa and can guide the development of monitoring strategies.},

abstract = {Transgenic crops producing insecticidal toxins are widely used to control insect pests. Their benefits would be lost if resistance to the toxins became widespread in pest populations. The most widely used resistance management method is the high-dose/refuge strategy. This requires toxin-free host plants as refuges near insecticidal crops, and toxin doses intended to be sufficiently high to kill insects heterozygous for a resistant allele, thereby rendering resistance functionally recessive. We have previously shown by mathematical modeling that mass-release of harmless susceptible (toxin-sensitive) insects engineered with repressible female-specific lethality using release of insects carrying a dominant lethal ([RIDL] Oxitec Limited, United Kingdom) technology could substantially delay or reverse the spread of resistance and reduce refuge sizes. Here, we explore this proposal in depth, studying a wide range of scenarios, considering impacts on population dynamics as well as evolution of allele frequencies, comparing with releases of natural fertile susceptible insects, and examining the effect of seasonality. We investigate the outcome for pest control for which the plant-incorporated toxins are not necessarily at a high dose (i.e., they might not kill all homozygous susceptible and all heterozygous insects). We demonstrate that a RIDL-based approach could form an effective component of a resistance management strategy in a wide range of genetic and ecological circumstances. Because there are significant threshold effects for several variables, we expect that a margin of error would be advisable in setting release ratios and refuge sizes, especially as the frequency and properties of resistant alleles may be difficult to measure accurately in the field.},

How can resistance be reversed in order to prolong the effectiveness of available treatments? Some key parameters affecting reversion of resistance are well known, such as the fitness cost of resistance. However, the population biological processes that actually cause resistance to persist or decline remain poorly characterized, and consequently our ability to manage reversion of resistance is limited. Where do susceptible genotypes that replace resistant lineages come from? What is the epidemiological scale of reversion? What information do we need to predict the mechanisms or likelihood of reversion? Here, we define some of the population biological processes that can drive reversion, using examples from a wide range of taxa and biocides. These processes differ primarily in the origin of revertant genotypes, but also in their sensitivity to factors such as coselection and compensatory evolution that can alter the rate of reversion, and the likelihood that resistance will re-emerge upon re-exposure to biocides. We therefore argue that discriminating among different types of reversion allows for better prediction of where resistance is most likely to persist.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Royal Entomological Society. The sterile insect technique is an area-wide pest control method that reduces agricultural pest populations by releasing mass-reared sterile insects, which then compete for mates with wild insects. Contemporary genetics-based technologies use insects that are homozygous for a repressible dominant lethal genetic construct rather than being sterilized by irradiation. Engineered strains of agricultural pest species, including moths such as the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella and fruit flies such as the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, have been developed with lethality that only operates on females. Transgenic crops expressing insecticidal toxins are widely used; the economic benefits of these crops would be lost if toxin resistance spread through the pest population. The primary resistance management method is a high-dose/refuge strategy, requiring toxin-free crops as refuges near the insecticidal crops, as well as toxin doses sufficiently high to kill wild-type insects and insects heterozygous for a resistance allele. Mass-release of toxin-sensitive engineered males (carrying female-lethal genes), as well as suppressing populations, could substantially delay or reverse the spread of resistance. These transgenic insect technologies could form an effective resistance management strategy. We outline some policy considerations for taking genetic insect control systems through to field implementation.},

Knockdown and mortality effects of an organophosphate Actellic 300 CS and pyrethroid K-Othrine WG 250 insecticides on the field-collected Culex quinquefasciatus were assessed bimonthly from July to November 2014, using World Health Organization (WHO) cones bioassay test. Knockdown and mortality rates were subjected to statistical analysis using $\chi$2 and Student t tests. Result of the bioassay test on C quinquefasciatus showed that plywood surfaces had the best residual knockdown activity of Actellic 300 CS with knockdown rate above the WHO-recommended threshold limit of ≥95{\%} for 30 days after treatment. This was followed by mud surface with knockdown rates ≥95{\%} threshold limit 15 days (97{\%}) after treatment. The lowest knockdown rates of less than 95{\%} were observed on cement surface throughout the assessment period. However, the knockdown rates of mosquitoes on deltamethrin WG 250-treated cement and plywood surfaces were 100{\%} and ≥95{\%}, respectively, at 30 days after treatment. But the knockdown activity was below the recommended threshold limit on mud surface during the 17 weeks trial. Knockdown activities varied significantly (p {\textless} .05), and it is a function of exposure periods, different surfaces, and insecticide formulations. The 24-hour mortality rates of Actellic 300 CS and K-Othrine WG 250 at 120 days after treatment were 83.6{\%} and 86.7{\%}, and 80{\%} and 83.3{\%}, on plywood and cement surfaces, respectively. A maximum residual period of 75 and 45 days were recorded for Actellic 300 CS and K-Othrine WG 250, respectively, on mud surface. Both Actellic 300 CS and K-Othrine 250 WG were highly effective against Culex mosquito. The extended residual activity of p-methyl CS compared with deltamethrin WG 250 makes it a suitable alternative insecticide against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes in Southwest Nigeria.},

Previous theoretical work has suggested three requirements for success of the refuge-high-dose strategy: a low initial frequency of the resistance allele, extensive mating between resistant and susceptible adults and recessive inheritance of resistance. In order to understand an observed decrease in resistance frequency and improve the potential for managing resistance better, we used analytical and simulation models for exploring the conditions that prevent or reverse the evolution of resistance, even when resistance is not rare initially. Assuming random mating and recessive or nearly recessive inheritance of resistance, the factors favouring reversal of resistance are non-recessive costs of resistance, low initial resistance allele frequency, large refuges, incomplete resistance and density-independent population growth in refuges.},

abstract = {One view of adaptation is that it proceeds by the slow and steady accumulation of beneficial mutations with small effects. It is difficult to test this model, since in most cases the genetic basis of adaptation can only be studied a posteriori with traits that have evolved for a long period of time through an unknown sequence of steps. In this paper, we show how ace-1, a gene involved in resistance to organophosphorous insecticide in the mosquito Culex pipiens, has evolved during 40 years of an insecticide control program. Initially, a major resistance allele with strong deleterious side effects spread through the population. Later, a duplication combining a susceptible and a resistance ace-1 allele began to spread but did not replace the original resistance allele, as it is sublethal when homozygous. Last, a second duplication, (also sublethal when homozygous) began to spread because heterozygotes for the two duplications do not exhibit deleterious pleiotropic effects. Double overdominance now maintains these four alleles across treated and nontreated areas. Thus, ace-1 evolution does not proceed via the steady accumulation of beneficial mutations. Instead, resistance evolution has been an erratic combination of mutation, positive selection, and the rearrangement of existing variation leading to complex genetic architecture.},

After target site-based (knockdown resistance; kdr) pyrethroid resistance was detected in 2004 in Anopheles coluzzii (formerly known as the M form of the Anopheles gambiae complex), the carbamate bendiocarb was introduced. Subsequent analysis showed that kdr alone was not operationally significant, so pyrethroid-based IRS was successfully reintroduced in 2012. In 2007 and 2014–2015, mass distribution of new pyrethroid LLINs was undertaken to increase the net coverage levels. The combined selection pressure of IRS and LLINs resulted in an increase in the frequency of pyrethroid resistance in 2015. In addition to a significant increase in kdr frequency, an additional metabolic pyrethroid resistance mechanism had been selected. Increased metabolism of the pyrethroid deltamethrin was linked with up-regulation of the cytochrome P450 CYP9K1. The increase in resistance prompted a reversion to bendiocarb IRS in 2016 to avoid a resurgence of malaria, in line with the national Malaria Control Program plan.},

abstract = {It is anticipated that malaria elimination efforts in Africa will be hampered by increasing resistance to the limited arsenal of insecticides approved for use in public health. However, insecticide susceptibility status of vector populations evaluated under standard insectary test conditions can give a false picture of the threat, as the thermal environment in which the insect and insecticide interact plays a significant role in insecticide toxicity. The effect of temperature on the expression of the standard WHO insecticide resistance phenotype was examined using Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus strains: a susceptible strain and the derived resistant strain, selected in the laboratory for resistance to DDT or pyrethroids. The susceptibility of mosquitoes to the pyrethroid deltamethrin or the carbamate bendiocarb was assessed at 18, 25 or 30 °C. The ability of the pyrethroid synergist piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) to restore pyrethroid susceptibility was also assessed at these temperatures. Temperature impacted the toxicity of deltamethrin and bendiocarb. Although the resistant An. funestus strain was uniformly resistant to deltamethrin across temperatures, increasing temperature increased the resistance of the susceptible An. arabiensis strain. Against susceptible An. funestus and resistant An. arabiensis females, deltamethrin exposure at temperatures both lower and higher than standard insectary conditions increased mortality. PBO exposure completely restored deltamethrin susceptibility at all temperatures. Bendiocarb displayed a consistently positive temperature coefficient against both susceptible and resistant An. funestus strains, with survival increasing as temperature increased. Environmental temperature has a marked effect on the efficacy of insecticides used in public health against important African malaria vectors. Caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions about a chemical's efficacy from laboratory assays performed at only one temperature, as phenotypic resistance can vary significantly even over a temperature range that could be experienced by mosquitoes in the field during a single day. Similarly, it might be inappropriate to assume equal efficacy of a control tool over a geographic area where local conditions vary drastically. Additional studies into the effects of temperature on the efficacy of insecticide-based interventions under field conditions are warranted.},

abstract = {Insect management strategies for agricultural crop pests must reduce selection for insecticide resistant mutants while providing effective control of the insect pest. One management strategy that has long been advocated is the application of insecticides at the maximum permitted dose. This has been found, under some circumstances, to be able to prevent the resistance allele frequency from increasing. However this approach may, under different circumstances, lead to rapid selection for resistance to the insecticide. To test when a high dose would be an effective resistance management strategy, we present a flexible deterministic model of a population of an insect pest of agricultural crops. The model includes several possible life-history traits including sexual or asexual reproduction, diploid or haplodiploid genetics, univoltine or multivoltine life cycle, so that the high dose strategy can be tested for many different insect pests. Using this model we aim to identify the key characteristics of pests that make either a high dose or a low dose of insecticide optimal for resistance management. Two outputs are explored: firstly whether the frequency of the resistance allele increases over time or remains low indefinitely; and secondly whether lowering the dose of insecticide applied reduces or increases the rate of selection for the resistance allele. It is demonstrated that with high immigration resistance can be suppressed. This suppression however, is rarely lost if the insecticide dose is reduced, and is absent altogether when individuals move from the treated population back into an untreated population. Reducing the dose of insecticide often resulted in slower development of resistance, except where the population combined a high influx of less resistant individuals into the treated population, a recessive resistance gene and a high efficacy, in which case reducing the dose of insecticide could result in faster selection for resistance.},

abstract = {A prominent hypothesis about insecticide resistance is that genes of major effect play a key role in field-evolved resistance because the intensity of selection is extremely high in the field. A corollary hypothesis is that the lower intensity of selection in laboratory selection experiments favors polygenic control of insecticide resistance. Contrary to these hypotheses, a literature review revealed that the intensity of selection for insecticide resistance in the field varies widely and overlaps broadly with selection intensities in the laboratory. Also contrary to these hypotheses, results from simulations of population genetic models suggest that selection intensities typical of laboratory selection experiments favor resistance that is conferred by major genes. Major genes dominated responses to selection for resistance across a wide range of simulated selection intensities, with and without fitness costs and refuges. The simulation results also suggest that the intensity of selection, rather than the number of loci conferring resistance, is central in determining rates of resistance evolution and effectiveness of refuges.},

abstract = {The Santa Luiza strain of the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus (Canestrini) (Acari: Ixodidae), is resistant to both permethrin and amitraz. A study was conducted at the USDA Cattle Fever Tick Research Laboratory in Texas to investigate the genetic basis of permethrin resistance with cross-mating experiments, and to determine the mechanisms of permethrin resistance through synergist bioassays and biochemical analysis of esterase profiles. The Mu{\~{n}}oz strain, an acaricide-susceptible reference strain, was used as the susceptible parent and the Santa Luiza strain, originating in Brazil, was used as the resistant parent. The Food and Agriculture Organization larval packet test was used to measure the levels of susceptibility of larvae of the parental strains, F1, backcross, F2, and F3 generations to permethrin. Results of reciprocal crossing experiments suggested that permethrin resistance was inherited as an incomplete recessive trait. There was no significant maternal effect on larval progeny's susceptibility to permethrin in the F1 and subsequent generations. The values of the degree of dominance were estimated at -0.700 and -0.522 for the F1 larvae with resistant and susceptible female parents, respectively. Results of bioassays on larval progeny of the F1 backcrossed with the resistant parent strain and of the F2 generations suggested that one major gene was responsible for permethrin resistance in the Santa Luiza strain. Selection of F3 larvae with either permethrin or amitraz led to significantly increased resistance to both permethrin and amitraz, indicating a close linkage between genes responsible for permethrin and amitraz resistance. The possible involvement of metabolic enzymes in permethrin resistance in the Santa Luiza strain of B. microplus was dismissed by the lack of enhanced synergism by TPP or PBO, as observed in synergist bioassays, as well as by the lack of enhanced esterase activity in the Santa Luiza strain relative to the susceptible strain. The results of this study suggest that other mechanisms, including a possible new sodium channel mutation that is different from the one currently known, may be responsible for permethrin resistance in the Santa Luiza strain of B. microplus.},

abstract = {Aim: The evolution of pesticide resistance through space and time is of great economic significance to modern agricultural production systems, and consequently, is often well documented. It can thus be used to dissect the evolutionary and ecological processes that underpin large-scale evolutionary responses. There are now nearly 600 documented cases of pesticide resistance in arthropod pests. Although the evolution of resistance is often attributed to the persistent use of chemicals for pest suppression, the rate of development of resistance should also depend on other factors, including climatic conditions that influence population size and generation time. Here, we test whether climatic variables are linked to evolution of resistance by examining the spatial pattern of pyrethroid resistance in an important agricultural pest. Location: Southern, agricultural regions of Australia. Time period: 2007-2015. Major taxa studied: The redlegged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor. Methods: We quantified patterns of chemical usage based on paddock histories and collated long-term climatic data. These data were then compared against presence-absence data on resistance using a boosted regression-tree approach, applied here for the first time to the spatial categorization of pesticide resistance. Results: Although chemical usage was a key driver of resistance, our analysis revealed climate-based signals in the spatial distribution of resistance, linked to regional variation in aridity, temperature seasonality and precipitation patterns. Climatic regions supporting increased voltinism were positively correlated with resistance, in line with expectations that increased voltinism should accelerate evolutionary responses to selection pressures. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prediction of rapid evolutionary processes at continental scales, such as pesticide resistance, will be improved through methods that incorporate climate and ecology, in addition to more immediate selection pressures, such as chemical usage. Boosted regression trees present a powerful tool in the management of resistance issues that has hitherto not been used.},

abstract = {While insecticides have greatly improved human health and agricultural production worldwide, their utility has been limited by the evolution of resistance in many major pests, including some that became pests only as a result of insecticide use. Insecticide resistance is both an interesting example of the adaptability of insect pests, and, in the design of resistance management programmes, a useful application of evolutionary biology. Pest susceptibility is a valuable natural resource that has been squandered; at the same time, it is becoming increasingly expensive to develop new insecticides. Pest control tactics should therefore take account of the possibility of resistance evolution. One of the best ways to retard resistance evolution is to use insecticides only when control by natural enemies fails to limit economic damage. This review summarizes the recent literature on insecticide resistance as an example of adaptation, and demonstrates how population genetics and ecology can be used to manage the resistance problem. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Background: Scale-up of insecticide-based interventions has averted more than 500 million malaria cases since 2000. Increasing insecticide resistance could herald a rebound in disease and mortality. We aimed to investigate whether insecticide resistance was associated with loss of effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets and increased malaria disease burden. Methods: This WHO-coordinated, prospective, observational cohort study was done at 279 clusters (villages or groups of villages in which phenotypic resistance was measurable) in Benin, Cameroon, India, Kenya, and Sudan. Pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets were the principal form of malaria vector control in all study areas; in Sudan this approach was supplemented by indoor residual spraying. Cohorts of children from randomly selected households in each cluster were recruited and followed up by community health workers to measure incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence of infection. Mosquitoes were assessed for susceptibility to pyrethroids using the standard WHO bioassay test. Country-specific results were combined using meta-analysis. Findings: Between June 2, 2012, and Nov 4, 2016, 40 000 children were enrolled and assessed for clinical incidence during 1{\textperiodcentered}4 million follow-up visits. 80 000 mosquitoes were assessed for insecticide resistance. Long-lasting insecticidal net users had lower infection prevalence (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0{\textperiodcentered}63, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}51–0{\textperiodcentered}78) and disease incidence (adjusted rate ratio [RR] 0{\textperiodcentered}62, 0{\textperiodcentered}41–0{\textperiodcentered}94) than did non-users across a range of resistance levels. We found no evidence of an association between insecticide resistance and infection prevalence (adjusted OR 0{\textperiodcentered}86, 0{\textperiodcentered}70–1{\textperiodcentered}06) or incidence (adjusted RR 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}72–1{\textperiodcentered}10). Users of nets, although significantly better protected than non-users, were nevertheless subject to high malaria infection risk (ranging from an average incidence in net users of 0{\textperiodcentered}023, [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}016–0{\textperiodcentered}033] per person-year in India, to 0{\textperiodcentered}80 [0{\textperiodcentered}65–0{\textperiodcentered}97] per person year in Kenya; and an average infection prevalence in net users of 0{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} [0{\textperiodcentered}5–1{\textperiodcentered}3] in India to an average infection prevalence of 50{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} [43{\textperiodcentered}4–58{\textperiodcentered}2] in Benin). Interpretation: Irrespective of resistance, populations in malaria endemic areas should continue to use long-lasting insecticidal nets to reduce their risk of infection. As nets provide only partial protection, the development of additional vector control tools should be prioritised to reduce the unacceptably high malaria burden.

In addition, historical events may blur the respective effects of selection and drift during the course of replacement. We address the relative importance of these processes in the evolution of insecticide resistance genes in the mosquito Culex pipiens. The resistance allele, Ester2, has a broad geographic distribution compared to the other resistance alleles. To distinguish between the different processes explaining this distribution, we reviewed the literature and analysed updated data from the Montpellier area of southern France. Overall, our data indicate that Ester2 prevails over other Ester resistance alleles in moderately treated areas. Such conditions are common and favour the hypothesis of selection acting at a local level. This places an emphasis on the importance of ecological conditions during the evolution of resistance. Finally, we highlight that historical events have contributed to its spread in some areas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria control today is threatened by widespread insecticide resistance in vector populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of a mixture of unrelated insecticides for indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LNs) or as a combination of interventions for improved vector control and insecticide resistance management. Studies investigating the efficacy of these different strategies are necessary. METHODS: The efficacy of Interceptor((R)) G2 LN, a newly developed LN treated with a mixture of chlorfenapyr (a pyrrole) and alpha-cypermethrin (a pyrethroid), was compared to a combined chlorfenapyr IRS and Interceptor((R)) LN (a standard alpha-cypermethrin LN) intervention in experimental huts in Cove Southern Benin, against wild, free-flying, pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.l. A direct comparison was also made with a pyrethroid-only net (Interceptor((R)) LN) alone and chorfenapyr IRS alone. RESULTS: WHO resistance bioassays performed during the trial demonstrated a pyrethroid resistance frequency of {\textgreater}90{\%} in the wild An. gambiae s.l. from the Cove hut site. Mortality in the control (untreated net) hut was 5{\%}. Mortality with Interceptor((R)) LN (24{\%}) was lower than with chlorfenapyr IRS alone (59{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). The combined Interceptor((R)) LN and chlorfenapyr IRS intervention and the mixture net (Interceptor((R)) G2 LN) provided significantly higher mortality rates (73 and 76{\%}, respectively) and these did not differ significantly between both treatments (P = 0.15). Interceptor LN induced 46{\%} blood-feeding inhibition compared to the control untreated net, while chlorfenapyr IRS alone provided none. Both mixture/combination strategies also induced substantial levels of blood-feeding inhibition (38{\%} with combined interventions and 30{\%} with Interceptor((R)) G2 LN). A similar trend of improved mortality of pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s.l. from Cove was observed with Interceptor((R)) G2 LN (79{\%}) compared to Interceptor LN (42{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) in WHO tunnel tests. CONCLUSION: The use of chlorfenapyr and alpha-cypermethrin together as a mixture on nets (Interceptor((R)) G2 LN) or a combined chlorfenapyr IRS and pyrethroid LN intervention provides improved control of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors by inducing significantly higher levels of mortality through the chlorfenapyr component and providing personal protection through the pyrethroid component. Both strategies are comparable in their potential to improve the control of malaria transmitted by pyrethroid resistant mosquito vectors.},

However, such tools require substantial scientific evidence, which is costly to acquire. The value of information (VOI) has been proposed as a metric for gauging the value of reduced model uncertainty. We apply this concept to an evidenced-based Malaria Decision Analysis Support Tool (MDAST) designed for application in East Africa. In developing MDAST, substantial gaps in the scientific evidence base were identified regarding insecticide resistance in malaria vector control and the effectiveness of alternative mosquito control approaches, including larviciding. We identify four entomological parameters in the model (two for insecticide resistance and two for larviciding) that involve high levels of uncertainty and to which outputs in MDAST are sensitive. We estimate and compare a VOI for combinations of these parameters in evaluating three policy alternatives relative to a status quo policy. We find having perfect information on the uncertain parameters could improve program net benefits by up to 5-21{\%}, with the highest VOI associated with jointly eliminating uncertainty about reproductive speed of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes and initial efficacy of larviciding at reducing the emergence of new adult mosquitoes. Future research on parameter uncertainty in decision analysis of malaria control policy should investigate the VOI with respect to other aspects of malaria transmission (such as antimalarial resistance), the costs of reducing uncertainty in these parameters, and the extent to which imperfect information about these parameters can improve payoffs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long half-lives of malaria 'partner' drugs are a potent force selecting for drug resistance. Clinical trials can quantify this effect by estimating a window of selection (WoS), defined as the amount of time post-treatment when drug levels are sufficiently high that resistant parasites can re-establish an infection while preventing drug-sensitive parasites from establishing viable infections.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The ability of clinical data to accurately estimate the true WoS was investigated using standard pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models for three widely used malaria drugs: artemether-lumefantrine (AR-LF), artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ). Estimates of the clinical WoS either (1) ignored all new infections occurring after the 63-day follow-up period, as is currently done in clinical trials, or, (2) recognized that all individuals would eventually be re-infected and arbitrarily assigned them a new infection day.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The results suggest current methods of estimating the clinical WoS underestimate the true WoS by as much as 9 days for AR-LF, 33 days for AS-MQ and 7 days for DHA-PPQ. The new method of estimating clinical WoS (i.e., retaining all individuals in the analysis) was significantly better at estimating the true WoS for AR-LF and AS-MQ.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Previous studies, based on clinically observed WoS, have probably underestimated the 'true' WoS and hence the role of drugs with long half-lives in driving resistance. This has important policy implications: high levels of drug use are inevitable in mass drug administration programmes and intermittent preventative treatment programmes and the analysis herein suggests these policies will be far more potent drivers of resistance than previously thought.},

abstract = {Background: Vector-borne diseases are important public health issues and, consequently, in silico models that simulate them can be useful. The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model simulates the population dynamics of an epidemic and can be easily adapted to vector-borne diseases, whereas the Hardy-Weinberg model simulates allele frequencies and can be used to study insecticide resistance evolution. The aim of the present study is to develop a coupled system that unifies both models, therefore enabling the analysis of the effects of vector population genetics on the population dynamics of an epidemic. Methods: Our model consists of an ordinary differential equation system. We considered the populations of susceptible, infected and recovered humans, as well as susceptible and infected vectors. Concerning these vectors, we considered a pair of alleles, with complete dominance interaction that determined the rate of mortality induced by insecticides. Thus, we were able to separate the vectors according to the genotype. We performed three numerical simulations of the model. In simulation one, both alleles conferred the same mortality rate values, therefore there was no resistant strain. In simulations two and three, the recessive and dominant alleles, respectively, conferred a lower mortality. Results: Our numerical results show that the genetic composition of the vector population affects the dynamics of human diseases. We found that the absolute number of vectors and the proportion of infected vectors are smaller when there is no resistant strain, whilst the ratio of infected people is larger in the presence of insecticide-resistant vectors. The dynamics observed for infected humans in all simulations has a very similar shape to real epidemiological data. Conclusion: The population genetics of vectors can affect epidemiological dynamics, and the presence of insecticide-resistant strains can increase the number of infected people. Based on the present results, the model is a basis for development of other models and for investigating population dynamics.},

In total, 31 Lolium rigidum populations were collected from sites with no previous history of exposure to herbicides and where there was little probability of gene flow from adjacent resistant populations. The mean survival frequency across all 31 populations following two applications of commercial rates (375 g ha(-1)) of the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) inhibiting herbicide, diclofop-methyl was 0.43{\%}. Survivors from five of these populations were grown to maturity and seed was collected. Dose-response experiments compared population level resistance to diclofop-methyl in these selected lines with their original parent populations. A single cycle of herbicide selection significantly increased resistance in all populations (LD(50) R:S ratios ranged from 2.8 to 23.2), confirming the inheritance and genetic basis of phenotypic resistance. In vitro assays of ACCase inhibition by diclofop acid indicated that resistance was due to a non-target-site mechanism. Following selection with diclofop-methyl, the five L. rigidum populations exhibited diverse patterns of cross-resistance to ACCase and ALS-inhibiting herbicides, suggesting that different genes or gene combinations were responsible for resistance. The relevance of these results to the management of herbicide resistance are discussed.},

abstract = {It is now generally accepted that if nothing is done and insecticide resistance in malaria vectors especially to pyrethroids eventually led to widespread failure of current vector control strategies, the progress achieved so far in reducing the burden of malaria could be reversed. Interventions and operational tactics capable of controlling insecticide resistant malaria vector populations and delaying the evolution of resistance need to be urgently identified and properly investigated. One important insecticide resistance management strategy is to expose vector populations to a combination of unrelated insecticides. In this study I investigated the potential of this combination concept to control and manage the spread of indoor resting insecticide resistant African malaria vectors. A series of field evaluations were performed in experimental huts in selected malaria endemic sites to investigate; 1.the impact of combining non-pyrethroid IRS or wall linings with pyrethroid LLINs against malaria vector populations with different levels of insecticide resistance and 2.The efficacy of LLINs treated with a pyrethroid and an alternative compound against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes. The capacity of the combined intervention approach to delay the spread of insecticide resistance genes was investigated via genotyping studies. I demonstrate that the use of combined interventions and mixture net with unrelated insecticides is an effective way to improve the control of pyrethroid resistance malaria vectors. However, the performance of these combinations will undoubtedly depend on the levels and type of resistance encountered. Where resistance to both insecticides exists, improved control is unlikely. While the use of single interventions would likely exacerbate resistance the combinations would be less beneficial for preventing selection of insecticide resistance when resistance genes are already well established. The impact of these findings on malaria vector control and resistance management is discussed.},

The kdr mutation has almost reached fixation in An. gambiae s.s. in Muleba. This change has the potential to jeopardize malaria control interventions carried out in the region. Trends in insecticide resistance were monitored in two intervention villages using World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility test kits. Additional mechanisms contributing to observed phenotypic resistance were investigated using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) bottle bioassays with piperonylbutoxide (PBO) and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) synergists. Resistance genotyping for kdr and Ace-1 alleles was conducted using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In both study villages, high phenotypic resistance to several pyrethroids and DDT was observed, with mortality in the range of 12-23{\%}. There was a sharp decrease in mortality in An. gambiae s.l. exposed to bendiocarb (carbamate) from 84{\%} in November 2011 to 31{\%} in December 2012 after two rounds of bendiocarb-based indoor residual spraying (IRS). Anopheles gambiae s.l. remained susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl (organophosphate). Bendiocarb-based IRS did not lead to the reversion of pyrethroid resistance. There was no evidence for selection for Ace-1 resistance alleles.

abstract = {Global emergence of arboviruses is a growing public health concern, since most of these diseases have no vaccine or prevention treatment available. In this scenario, vector control through the use of chemical insecticides is one of the most important prevention tools. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has been increasingly compromised by the development of strong resistance observed in field populations, even in spite of fitness costs usually associated to resistance. Using a stage-structured deterministic model parametrised for the Aedes aegypti--the main vector for dengue--we investigated the persistence of resistance by studying the time for a population which displays resistance to insecticide to revert to a susceptible population. By means of a comprehensive series of in-silico experiments, we studied this reversal time as a function of fitness costs and the initial presence of the resistance allele in the population. The resulting map provides both a guiding and a surveillance tool for public health officers to address the resistance situation of field populations. Application to field data from Brazil indicates that reversal can take, in some cases, decades even if fitness costs are not small. As by-products of this investigation, we were able to fit very simple formulas to the reversal times as a function of either cost or initial presence of the resistance allele. In addition, the in-silico experiments also showed that density dependent regulation plays an important role in the dynamics, slowing down the reversal process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tools with the potential to predict risks of insecticide resistance and aid the evaluation and design of resistance management tactics are of value to all sectors of the pest management community. Here we describe use of a versatile individual-based model of resistance evolution to simulate how strategies employing single and multiple insecticides influence resistance development in the pollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus. RESULTS: Under repeated exposure to a single insecticide, resistance evolved faster to a pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin) than to a pyridine azomethane (pymetrozine), due to difference in initial efficacy. A mixture of these compounds delayed resistance compared to use of single products. The effectiveness of rotations depended on the sequence in which compounds were applied in response to pest density thresholds. Effectiveness of a mixture strategy declined with reductions in grower compliance. At least 50{\%} compliance was needed to cause some delay in resistance development. CONCLUSION: No single strategy meets all requirements for managing resistance. It is important to evaluate factors that prevail under particular pest management scenarios. The model used here provides operators with a valuable means for evaluating and extending sound resistance management advice, as well as understanding needs and opportunities offered by new control techniques.},

Activity of males and virgin females of both species, as recorded in an acoustic actograph, occurred mainly at dusk (the E peak). The activity pattern of An.gambiae males was not affected by resistance genes; in mating competition and predator avoidance experiments, however, RR males were less successful than RS males which were less successful than SS males. The activity pattern of An.stephensi differed from An.gambiae in that the E peaks of RR males and females in a gradual dusk regime were out of synchrony with those of SS and RS, the E peaks of RR occurring slightly later. Thus, RR males and females tended to mate assortatively in mate competition experiments. When a sudden dusk regime was substituted for the gradual dusk regime, activity of RR An.stephensi became synchronized with SS and RS activity, but in mating competition experiments RR still tended to mate assortatively. Estimates of male competitiveness, together with previously-obtained estimates of female fitness, were included in population genetics models. Computer simulations showed that the frequency of resistance in populations of An.gambiae and An.stephensi should decrease in the absence of insecticide at a rate comparable with known field reversions.},

The CS formulations were tested alongside an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation of pirimiphos methyl and a CS formulation of the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The two CS formulations of pirimiphos methyl gave prolonged control of An. gambiae and Cx. quinquefasciatus. In cement huts application rates of 0.5 g/m(2) induced high mortality of An. gambiae for almost a year: overall mortality rates 87{\%} (95{\%} CI 82-91{\%}) and 92{\%} (95{\%} CI 88-94{\%}). In mud huts application rates of 1 g/m(2) induced high mortality of An. gambiae for 10 months: overall mortality rates 75{\%} (95{\%} CI 69-81{\%}) and 76{\%} (95{\%} CI 68-83{\%}). The EC formulation of pirimiphos methyl failed to control An. gambiae two months after spraying. The pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin demonstrated prolonged residual activity in bioassay tests but failed to control pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae that entered the huts. Pirimiphos methyl CS was highly active against Culex quinquefasciatus and gave control for 10 months in cement huts and 6 months in mud huts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Pirimiphos methyl CS (Actellic 300 CS) applied at 1 g/m(2) shows great promise for providing prolonged control of pyrethroid-resistant An gambiae and for delaying pyrethroid resistance.

abstract = {REX Consortium The efficacy of disease resistance genes in plants decreases over time because of the selection of virulent pathogen genotypes. A key goal of crop protection programs is to increase the durability of the resistance conferred by these genes. The spatial and temporal deployment of plant disease resistance genes is considered to be a major factor determining their durability. In the literature, four principal strategies combining resistance genes over time and space have been considered to delay the evolution of virulent pathogen genotypes. We reviewed this literature with the aim of determining which deployment strategy results in the greatest durability of resistance genes. Although theoretical and empirical studies comparing deployment strategies of more than one resistance gene are very scarce, they suggest that the overall durability of disease resistance genes can be increased by combining their presence in the same plant (pyramiding). Retrospective analyses of field monitoring data also suggest that the pyramiding of disease resistance genes within a plant is the most durable strategy. By extension, we suggest that the combination of disease resistance genes with other practices for pathogen control (pesticides, farming practices) may be a relevant management strategy to slow down the evolution of virulent pathogen genotypes.

abstract = {Evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds is a growing problem across the world, and it has been suggested that low herbicide rates may be contributing to this problem. An individual-based simulation model that represents weed population dynamics and the evolution of polygenic herbicide resistance was constructed and used to investigate whether using lower herbicide rates or standard rates at reduced efficacy could reduce the sustainability of cropping systems by causing faster increases in weed population density as herbicide resistance develops. A number of different possible genetic bases for resistance were considered, including monogenic resistance and polygenic resistance conferred by several genes. The results show that cutting herbicide rates does not affect the rate at which weed densities reach critical levels when resistance is conferred exclusively by a single dominant gene. In some polygenic situations, cutting herbicide rates substantially reduces sustainability, due to a combination of faster increase in resistance gene frequency and reduced kill rates in all genotypes, while in other polygenic situations the effect is small. Differences in sustainability depend on combined strength of the resistance genes, variability in phenotypic susceptibility and rate delivered, level of control due to alternative measures, and degree of genetic dominance and epistasis. In the situation where resistance can be conferred by both a single dominant major gene or a number of co-dominant minor genes in combination, the difference made by low rates depends on the relative initial frequency of the major and minor genes. These results show that careful consideration of herbicide rate and understanding the genetic basis of resistance are important aspects of weed management. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Insecticide use via indoor residual spraying (IRS) or treated nets is the primary method for controlling
malaria vector populations. The incidence of insecticide resistance in vector populations is burgeoning globally making
resistance management key to the design of effective malaria control and elimination strategies. Vector populations
can be assessed for insecticide resistance using a binary (susceptible or resistant) classification based on the use of the
standard WHO insecticide susceptibility assay for adult anopheline mosquitoes. However, the recent scaling up of vector
control activities has necessitated a revision of the WHO bioassay protocol to include the production of information that
not only diagnoses resistance but also gives information on the intensity of expression of resistance phenotypes
detected. This revised protocol is expected to inform on the range of resistance phenotypes in a target vector
population using discriminating/diagnostic insecticide concentrations (DC) as well as their potential operational
significance using 5× DC and 10× DC assays. The aim of this project was to use the revised protocol to assess
the intensity of pyrethroid resistance in a range of insecticide resistant Anopheles strains with known resistance
mechanisms and for which there is evidence of operational significance in the field setting from which these
colonies were derived.
Methods: Diagnostic concentration (DC) bioassays followed by 5× DC and 10× DC assays using the pyrethroid
insecticides permethrin and deltamethrin were conducted according to the standard WHO bioassay method
against pyrethroid resistant laboratory strains of Anopheles funestus, An. arabiensis and An. gambiae.
Results: Low to moderate resistance intensities were recorded for the An. arabiensis and An. gambiae strains
while moderate to high intensities were recorded for the An. funestus strains.
Conclusions: It is evident that resistance intensity assays can add predictive value to the decision making process in
vector control settings, although more so in an IRS setting and especially when bench-marked against resistance
phenotypes of known operational significance.},

abstract = {Malaria transmission has been substantially reduced across Africa through the distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). However, the emergence of insecticide resistance within mosquito vectors risks jeopardizing the future efficacy of this control strategy. The severity of this threat is uncertain because the consequences of resistance for mosquito fitness are poorly understood: while resistant mosquitoes are no longer immediately killed upon contact with LLINs, their transmission potential may be curtailed because of longer-term fitness costs that persist beyond the first 24 h after exposure. Here, we used a Bayesian state-space model to quantify the immediate (within 24 h of exposure) and delayed ({\textgreater}24 h after exposure) impact of insecticides on daily survival and malaria transmission potential of moderately and highly resistant laboratory populations of the major African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Contact with LLINs reduced the immediate survival of moderately and highly resistant An. gambiae strains by 60-100{\%} and 3-61{\%}, respectively, and delayed mortality impacts occurring beyond the first 24 h after exposure further reduced their overall life spans by nearly one-half. In total, insecticide exposure was predicted to reduce the lifetime malaria transmission potential of insecticide-resistant vectors by two-thirds, with delayed effects accounting for at least one-half of this reduction. The existence of substantial, previously unreported, delayed mortality effects within highly resistant malaria vectors following exposure to insecticides does not diminish the threat of growing resistance, but posits an explanation for the apparent paradox of continued LLIN effectiveness in the presence of high insecticide resistance.},

In laboratory assays, this level of resistance renders insecticides used to impregnate bed nets ineffective. Thus, the level of personal and community protection afforded by long-lasting insecticide-treated net campaigns will probably be reduced.

Effects of extreme events, precipitation regimes, and seasonality on diseases are still poorly studied. Thorough validation of models is still a challenge and is complicated by a lack of field and laboratory data. On a larger scale, the main challenges today lie in cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral transfer of data and methods.},

abstract = {Negative cross-resistance (NCR) occurs when a mutant allele confers (i) resistance to one toxic chemical and (ii) hyper-susceptibility to another. Sequential deployment of NCR toxins is useful for insect control in few situations (Pittendrigh et al., 2000). Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigated the concurrent use of a pair of NCR toxins to control a hypothetical insect pest population. When the toxins killed more heterozygotes than homozygotes, the resistance allele became either extremely common or rare depending on starting allelic frequency. If the NCR toxins did not kill the two homozygous groups equally, then the toxin with lesser toxicity eventually played a greater role in the control of the pest population. Based on our results, we present an approach for the systematic development of an NCR toxin after the commercial release of the first toxin. First, large-scale screens are performed to find chemicals that kill the resistant homozygous insects, but not the susceptible ones. Chemicals that preferentially kill resistant insects are then tested for toxicity to the heterozygotes. Those highly toxic to both homo- and heterozygotes are given the highest priority for development. This screen can be adapted to identify compounds useful in controlling antibiotic-, herbicide- or fungicide-resistant organisms. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance threatens effective vector control, especially for mosquitoes and malaria. To manage resistance, recommended insecticide use strategies include mixtures, sequences and rotations. New insecticides are being developed and there is an opportunity to develop use strategies that limit the evolution of further resistance in the short term. A 2013 review of modelling and empirical studies of resistance points to the advantages of mixtures. However, there is limited recent, accessible modelling work addressing the evolution of resistance under different operational strategies. There is an opportunity to improve the level of mechanistic understanding within the operational community of how insecticide resistance can be expected to evolve in response to different strategies. This paper provides a concise, accessible description of a flexible model of the evolution of insecticide resistance. The model is used to develop a mechanistic picture of the evolution of insecticide resistance and how it is likely to respond to potential insecticide use strategies. The aim is to reach an audience unlikely to read a more detailed modelling paper. The model itself, as described here, represents two independent genes coding for resistance to two insecticides. This allows the representation of the use of insecticides in isolation, sequence and mixtures. The model is used to demonstrate the evolution of resistance under different scenarios and how this fits with intuitive reasoning about selection pressure. Using an insecticide in a mixture, relative to alone, always prompts slower evolution of resistance to that insecticide. However, when resistance to both insecticides is considered, resistance thresholds may be reached later for a sequence relative to a mixture. Increasing the ability of insecticides to kill susceptible mosquitoes (effectiveness), has the most influence on favouring a mixture over a sequence because one highly effective insecticide provides more protection to another in a mixture. The model offers an accessible description of the process of insecticide resistance evolution and how it is likely to respond to insecticide use. A simple online user-interface allowing further exploration is also provided. These tools can contribute to an improved discussion about operational decisions in insecticide resistance management.},

Effective insecticide resistance management (IRM) is essential if the utility of current and future insecticides is to be preserved. Established in 1984, the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) is an international association of crop protection companies. IRAC serves as the Specialist Technical Group within CropLife International focused on ensuring the long term efficacy of insect, mite and tick control products through effective resistance management for sustainable agriculture and improved public health. A key function of IRAC is the continued development of the Mode of Action (MoA) classification scheme, which provides up-to-date information on the modes of action of new and established insecticides and acaricides and which serves as the basis for developing appropriate IRM strategies for crop protection and vector control. The IRAC MoA classification scheme covers more than 25 different modes of action and at least 55 different chemical classes. Diversity is the spice of resistance management by chemical means and thus it provides an approach to IRM providing a straightforward means to identify potential rotation/alternation options.},

These include long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and, to a lesser extent, indoor residual spraying (IRS). However, their effectiveness is threatened by widespread mosquito resistance to insecticides. Resistance to the insecticides used in LLINs (pyerthroids) is now ubiquitous in major malaria vectors; it is difficult to find areas without resistance and there are increasing reports of its intensification in some areas. Resistance to other insecticide classes commonly used for IRS (carbamates, organophosphates and organochlorines) also appears to be increasing in areas with malaria transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Malaria remains a major public health threat in Cameroon and disease prevention is facing strong challenges due to the rapid expansion of insecticide resistance in vector populations. The present review presents an overview of published data on insecticide resistance in the main malaria vectors in Cameroon to assist in the elaboration of future and sustainable resistance management strategies. METHODS A systematic search on mosquito susceptibility to insecticides and insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Cameroon was conducted using online bibliographic databases including PubMed, Google and Google Scholar. From each peer-reviewed paper, information on the year of the study, mosquito species, susceptibility levels, location, insecticides, data source and resistance mechanisms were extracted and inserted in a Microsoft Excel datasheet. The data collected were then analysed for assessing insecticide resistance evolution. RESULTS Thirty-three scientific publications were selected for the analysis. The rapid evolution of insecticide resistance across the country was reported from 2000 onward. Insecticide resistance was highly prevalent in both An. gambiae (s.l.) and An. funestus. DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin and bendiocarb appeared as the most affected compounds by resistance. From 2000 to 2017 a steady increase in the prevalence of kdr allele frequency was noted in almost all sites in An. gambiae (s.l.), with the L1014F kdr allele being the most prevalent. Several detoxification genes (particularly P450 monooxygenase) were associated with DDT, pyrethroids and bendiocarb resistance. In An. funestus, resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was mainly attributed to the 119F-GSTe2 metabolic resistance marker and over-expression of P450 genes whereas the 296S-RDL mutation was detected in dieldrin-resistant An. funestus. CONCLUSIONS The review provides an update of insecticide resistance status in malaria vector populations in Cameroon and stresses the need for further actions to reinforce malaria control strategies in the coming years.},

@article{Alout2017,
abstract = {Human malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium (Plasmodium falcip-arum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi). In 2015, 212 milion malaria cases were reported worldwide with approximately 429,000 deaths, 92{\%} of which occured in Africa. How-ever, several countries within sub-Saharan Africa have reported decreased numbers of malaria cases over the last several decades (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2016/en/). Plasmodium parasites are dependent on completing a complex life cycle in mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles, specifically, for transmission to occur. Thus, reducing the mosquito abundance or interfering with its ability to support the parasite cycle (i.e., the vector competence) can interrupt malaria transmission. However, not every species of Anopheles is a vector, and not all species of Plasmodium occur in all regions. In natural populations, the com-bination of Plasmodium–Anopheles species is very specific and leads to distinct epidemiology and transmission patterns. For example, the transmission of malaria parasites between humans is due primarly to the A. gambiae s.l.–P. falciparum combination, while in Southeast Asia, A. dirus and A. minimus–P. vivax are the main vectorial systems. This transmission potential between human hosts of a specific Anopheles population is characterized by the " vectorial capacity " and depends on the abundance, the feeding rate, the longevity, and the vector com-petence of female mosquitoes as well as the extrinsic incubation period of the parasite, which is the time for the pathogen to reach the transmissible stage from the midgut to the salivary glands of its vector. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of malaria infection deaths have been halved, with 79{\%} of this reduction being attributed to insecticide-based vector control (in-secticide-treated nets [ITNs] and indoor residual spraying [IRS]) [1]. Therefore, insecticide-based vector control still represents the most important and affordable method to alleviate the malaria burden by interrupting the transmission cycle, although insecticide-resistance fre-quency and intensity have increased dramatically in malaria vector populations. In an attempt to explain this discrepancy, we present 5 facts about insecticide resistance in regards to malaria control when the epidemiological and ecological contexts are considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the first-line tools for malaria prevention and control in Africa. Vector resistance to insecticides has been extensively studied, however the insecticidal effects of the nets and sprayed walls on pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes has not been studied thoroughly. We evaluated the bioefficacy of LLINs of different ages and lambda-cyhalothrin (ICON 10cs) on the sprayed mud walls for a period of time on malaria vector survivorship.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: WHO tube bioassay was performed using diagnostic doses of lambda-cyhalothrin (0.05 {\%}), permethrin (0.75 {\%}) and deltamethrin (0.05 {\%}). Cone bioassays were conducted on netting materials from 0 to 3 years old long-lasting insecticide-impregnated nets. Wall bioassays were performed monthly on mud slabs sprayed with lambdacyhalothrin over a period of seven months. All bioassays used An. gambiae mosquitoes collected from the field and the laboratory susceptible reference Kisumu strain. Concentration of the insecticides on the netting materials was examined using the gas chromatography method. Mosquitoes were identified to species level using PCR and genotyped for the kdr gene mutation frequencies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: WHO bioassays results showed that populations from five sites were highly resistant to the pyrethroids (mortalities ranged from 52.5 to 75.3 {\%}), and two sites were moderately resistant to these insecticides (80.4 - 87.2 {\%}). Homozygote kdr mutations of L1014S ranged from 73 to 88 {\%} in An. gambiae s.s. dominant populations whereas L1014S mutation frequencies were relatively low (7-31 {\%}) in An. arabiensis dominant populations. There was a significant decrease (P {\textless} 0.05) in mosquito mortality with time after the spray with both lambda-cyhalothrin (75 {\%} mortality after six months) and with the age of LLINs (60 {\%} mortality after 24 month). Field collected mosquitoes were able to survive exposure to both IRS and LLINs even with newly sprayed walls (86.6-93.5 {\%} mortality) and new LLINs (77.5-85.0 {\%} mortality), Wild mosquitoes collected from the field had significantly lower mortality rates to LLINs (59.6-85.0 {\%}) than laboratory reared susceptible strain (100 {\%}). Insecticide concentration decreased significantly from 0.14 $\mu$g/ml in the new nets to 0.077 $\mu$g/ml in nets older than 18 months (P {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study confirms that insecticide decay and developing levels of resistance have a negative contribution to reduced efficacy of ITN and IRS in western Kenya. These factors contribute to decreased efficacy of pyrethroid insectides in ongoing malaria control programs. In order to mitigate against the impact of insecticide resistance and decay it is important to follow the WHO policy to provide the residents with new LLINs every three years of use while maintaining a high level of LLINs coverage and usage. There is also need for urgent development and deployment of non-pyrethroid based vector control tools.},

@article{Chilcutt1995,
abstract = {Researchers have often assumed that slopes of concentration-mortality lines from pesticide bioassays change predictably as resistance evolves. In particular, many authors have used differences in slope among conspecific populations to make inferences about the progression of resistance and the genetic variation available for further increases in resistance. Such inferences are based on the assumption that slope is steepest in populations that are highly susceptible or highly resistant (i.e., such populations have less genetic variation than heterogeneous populations with intermediate levels of resistance). We tested this hypothesis independently for each of 41 sets of bioassay data of conspecific Variation in susceptibility to pesticides obtained from 26 articles published in the Journal of Economic Entomology during the past decade. These data represent 18 species of insects and mites and 25 pesticides. We used polynomial regression and a nonparametric approach to examine the relationship between slope and LC(50) for each set of bioassay data. We found that, for most pest and pesticide combinations, slopes of the concentration-mortality lines were not highest in the populations with highest and lowest LC(50)s. This result suggests that slope was not a good indicator of genetic Variation in susceptibility or that genetic Variation in susceptibility was not related simply to LC(50) The slope of the concentration-mortality line provides information about the phenotypic variation within a population, including genetic and environmental variation. If most of the phenotypic variation is not genetically based, variation in estimates of slope among conspecific populations may be caused primarily by changes in environmental variation and errors of estimation.

Precisely, how do malaria fighting actors profit from these developments, how do they deal with ensuing phenomena, such as the increase of data volume, and did these technologies bring new opportunities for fighting malaria? Eleven web platforms linked to spatio-temporal malaria information are reviewed, focusing on data, metadata, web services and categories of users. Though the web platforms are highly heterogeneous the review reveals that the latest advances in web technologies are underused. Information are rarely updated dynamically, metadata catalogues are absent, web services are more and more used, but rarely standardized, and websites are mainly dedicated to scientific communities, essentially researchers. Improvement of systems interoperability, through standardization, is an opportunity to be seized in order to allow real time information exchange and online multisource data analysis. To facilitate multidisciplinary/multiscale studies, the web of linked data and the semantic web innovations can be used in order to formalize the different view points of actors involved in the combat against malaria. By doing so, new malaria fighting strategies could take place, to tackle the bottlenecks listed in the United Nation Millennium Development Goals reports, but also specific issues highlighted by the World Health Organization such as malaria elimination in international borders.},

abstract = {Since the original Ross-Macdonald formulations of vector-borne disease transmission, there has been a broad proliferation of mathematical models of vector-borne disease, but many of these models retain most to all of the simplifying assumptions of the original formulations. Recently, there has been a new expansion of mathematical frameworks that contain explicit representations of the vector life cycle including aquatic stages, multiple vector species, host heterogeneity in biting rate, realistic vector feeding behavior, and spatial heterogeneity. In particular, there are now multiple frameworks for spatially explicit dynamics with movements of vector, host, or both. These frameworks are flexible and powerful, but require additional data to take advantage of these features. For a given question posed, utilizing a range of models with varying complexity and assumptions can provide a deeper understanding of the answers derived from models.},

abstract = {One of the most common strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases relies on the use of chemical pesticides to repel or kill the mosquito vector. Pesticide exposure interferes with several key biological functions in the mosquito and triggers a variety of adaptive responses whose underlying mechanisms are only partially elucidated. The availability of reference genome sequences opens up the possibility of tracking signatures of evolutionary changes, including the most recent, across the genomes of many vector species. In this review, we highlight the recent genomic changes, which contribute to the fascinating adaptation of malaria vectors of the sub-Saharan African region to intensive insecticide-based interventions. We emphasize the operational significance of detailed genomic knowledge for current monitoring and decision-making. Widespread use of insecticides provides an opportunity to examine the adaptive responses of target species to human interventions.Rapid evolution of anopheline mosquitoes represents a potential threat to any vector-based malaria control effort.The use of high-quality genomic data and gene-editing tools provides powerful strategies for characterizing insecticide resistance genes and their functions in mosquitoes.A better understanding of the genetic, behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying insecticide resistance will yield potentially vital knowledge for vector-borne disease control.},

Here we argue that the strength of selection can be a poor predictor of the rate of resistance emergence. It is possible for a resistant strain to be under negative selection and still emerge in an infection or spread in a population. Measuring the right parameters is a necessary first step toward the development of evidence-based resistance-management strategies.

abstract = {Insecticide-based interventions have contributed to ∼78{\%} of the reduction in the malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa since 2000. Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors could presage a catastrophic rebound in disease incidence and mortality. A major impediment to the implementation of insecticide resistance management strategies is that evidence of the impact of resistance on malaria disease burden is limited. A cluster randomized trial was conducted in Sudan with pyrethroid-resistant and carbamate-susceptible malaria vectors. Clusters were randomly allocated to receive either long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) alone or LLINs in combination with indoor residual spraying (IRS) with a pyrethroid (deltamethrin) insecticide in the first year and a carbamate (bendiocarb) insecticide in the two subsequent years. Malaria incidence was monitored for 3 y through active case detection in cohorts of children aged 1 to {\textless}10 y. When deltamethrin was used for IRS, incidence rates in the LLIN + IRS arm and the LLIN-only arm were similar, with the IRS providing no additional protection [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-3.0;P= 0.96)]. When bendiocarb was used for IRS, there was some evidence of additional protection [interaction IRR = 0.55 (95{\%} CI: 0.40-0.76;P{\textless} 0.001)]. In conclusion, pyrethroid resistance may have had an impact on pyrethroid-based IRS. The study was not designed to assess whether resistance had an impact on LLINs. These data alone should not be used as the basis for any policy change in vector control interventions.},

abstract = {Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is the application of insecticide to the interior walls of household structures that often serve as resting sites for mosquito vectors of malaria. Human exposure to malaria vectors is reduced when IRS involves proper application of pre-determined concentrations of the active ingredient specific to the insecticide formulation of choice. The impact of IRS can be affected by the dosage of insecticide, spray coverage, vector behavior, vector susceptibility to insecticides, and the residual efficacy of the insecticide applied. This report compiles data on the residual efficacy of insecticides used in IRS campaigns implemented by the United States President's Malaria Initiative (PMI)/United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in 17 African countries and compares observed length of efficacy to ranges proposed in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Additionally, this study provides initial analysis on variation of mosquito mortality depending on the surface material of sprayed structures, country spray program, year of implementation, source of tested mosquitoes, and type of insecticide. Residual efficacy of the insecticides used for PMI/USAID-supported IRS campaigns was measured in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The WHO cone bioassay tests were used to assess the mortality rate of mosquitoes exposed to insecticide-treated mud, wood, cement, and other commonly used housing materials. Baseline tests were performed within weeks of IRS application and follow-up tests were continued until the mortality of exposed mosquitoes dropped below 80{\%} or the program monitoring period ended. Residual efficacy in months was then evaluated with respect to WHO guidelines that provide suggested ranges of residual efficacy for insecticide formulations recommended for use in IRS. Where the data allowed, direct comparisons of mosquito mortality rates were then made to determine any significant differences when comparing insecticide formulation, country, year, surface type, and the source of the mosquitoes used in testing. The residual efficacy of alpha-cypermethrin ranged from 4 to 10 months (average = 6.4 months), with no reported incidents of underperformance when compared to the efficacy range provided in WHO guidelines. Deltamethrin residual efficacy results reported a range of 1 to 10 months (average = 4.9 months), with two instances of underperformance. The residual efficacy of bendiocarb ranged from 2 weeks to 7 months (average = 2.8 months) and failed to achieve proposed minimum efficacy on 14 occasions. Lastly, long-lasting pirimiphos-methyl efficacy ranged from 2 months to 9 months (average = 5.3 months), but reported 13 incidents of underperformance. Much of the data used to determine application rate and expected efficacy of insecticides approved for use in IRS programs are collected in controlled laboratory or pilot field studies. However, the generalizability of the results obtained under controlled conditions are limited and unlikely to account for variation in locally sourced housing materials, climate, and the myriad other factors that may influence the bio-efficacy of insecticides. Here, data are presented that confirm the variation in residual efficacy observed when monitoring household surfaces sprayed during PMI/USAID-supported IRS campaigns. All insecticides except alpha-cypermethrin showed evidence of failing to meet the minimum range of residual efficacy proposed in WHO criteria at least once. However, this initial effort in characterizing program-wide insecticide bio-efficacy indicates that some insecticides, such as bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl, may be vulnerable to variations in the local environment. Additionally, the comparative analysis performed in this study provides evidence that mosquito mortality rates differ with respect to factors including: the types of insecticide sprayed, surface material, geographical location, year of spraying, and tested mosquitoes. It is, therefore, important to locally assess the residual efficacy of insecticides on various surfaces to inform IRS programming.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance is a serious concern in modern agriculture, and an understanding of the underlying evolutionary processes is pivotal to prevent the problem. The bean bug Riptortus pedestris, a notorious pest of leguminous crops, acquires a specific Burkholderia symbiont from the environment every generation, and harbors the symbiont in the midgut crypts. The symbiont's natural role is to promote insect development but the insect host can also obtain resistance against the insecticide fenitrothion (MEP) by acquiring MEP-degrading Burkholderia from the environment. To understand the developing process of the symbiont-mediated MEP resistance in response to the application of the insecticide, we investigated here in parallel the soil bacterial dynamics and the infected gut symbionts under different MEP-spraying conditions by culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses, in conjunction with stinkbug rearing experiments. We demonstrate that MEP application did not affect the total bacterial soil population but significantly decreased its diversity while it dramatically increased the proportion of MEP-degrading bacteria, mostly Burkholderia. Moreover, we found that the infection of stinkbug hosts with MEP-degrading Burkholderia is highly specific and efficient, and is established after only a few times of insecticide spraying at least in a field soil with spraying history, suggesting that insecticide resistance could evolve in a pest bug population more quickly than was thought before.},

abstract = {The rotation of the use of chemically unrelated insecticides has been advocated to delay the build up of resistance. To examine this concept in the laboratory, Anopheles albimanus and Culex guinquefasciatus were subjected to two kinds of rotational selection which may be referred to as short term pre-planned rotation and "opportunistic" rotation. No difference was observed between these two methods in term of the time for each resistance level to reach 5Q{\%}. The effectiveness of selection for resistance depends on the protection conferred by resistance genes and this was tested by laboratory releases of the DDT resistant and susceptible homozygotes and heterozygotes of An. gambiae into DDT sprayed and unsprayed miniature huts. All the genotypes were killed with freshly applied DDT but survivors were observed from month 2, 3 and 5 onwards for RR, RS and SS genotypes, respectively. Persistence of DDT on the sprayed wall and roof of the mud hut was studied by bioassays and biochemical assays on scrapings from the wall and roof. Linkage between resistance genes could effect the rotational use of insecticides. No linkage was found between propoxur and dieldrin resistance genes by combining bioassay and biochemical methods. As a preparation for a field studies in Malaysian field collected Aedes aegypti and Culex guinguefasciatus larvae were selected with temephos and Bti. Cx guinguefasciatus responded to temephos selection but Ae. aegypti did not respond to temephos and neither species responded to Bti selection. {\~{}} Caged adults were exposed to thermal fogging in the field. The partially resistant Cx guinguefasciatus strain hardly survived any better than susceptible strains. Resistant and susceptible larvae were exposed to water samples from containers which had been treated with temephos sand granules. 100{\%} mortality was obtained for all the strains up to week 6. Resistant Culex started to survive at week 7 but susceptibles did not do so until week ten. The prospects for the various proposed strategies for resistance management are discussed. {\%}Z The Department of Medical Parasitology (1992)},

abstract = {The following possible methods of minimising the risks of resistance in mosquitoes are considered: (a) adjustment of the dosage and frequency of spraying so that resistance genes are effectively recessive; (b) detection and eradication of new foci of resistance before they have a chance to spread; (c) spraying a 'mosaic' of unrelated insecticides with the intention that immigrants from one sector of the mosaic to another will 'dilute' the frequency of resistance genes; (d) re-introduction of susceptibility genes into the progeny of wild females by the release of heterozygous males with resistance genes translocated on to their Y chromosome so that they are protected from insecticidal killing but will pass susceptibility to their female progeny; and (e) replacement of a resistant by a susceptible population by means of a negatively heterotic system such as bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility. A plausible case can be made for each of these methods based on theoretical models and appropriate assumptions. However, an assessment of whether any of them will really be of any value depends on the answers to certain questions in the field.

abstract = {Pyramid transgenic crops that express two Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins hold great potential for reducing insect damage and slowing the evolution of resistance to the toxins. Here, we analyzed a suite of models for pyramid Bt crops to illustrate factors that should be considered when implementing the high dose-refuge strategy for resistance management; this strategy involves the high expression of toxins in Bt plants and use of non-Bt plants as refuges. Although resistance evolution to pyramid Bt varieties should in general be slower, resistance to pyramid Bt varieties is nonetheless driven by the same evolutionary processes as single Bt-toxin varieties. The main advantage of pyramid varieties is the low survival of insects heterozygous for resistance alleles. We show that there are two modes of resistance evolution. When populations of purely susceptible insects persist, leading to density dependence, the speed of resistance evolution changes slowly with the proportion of refuges. However, once the proportion of non-Bt plants crosses the threshold below which a susceptible population cannot persist, the speed of resistance evolution increases rapidly. This suggests that adaptive management be used to guarantee persistence of susceptible populations. We compared the use of seed mixtures in which Bt and non-Bt plants are sown in the same fields to the use of spatial refuges. As found for single Bt varieties, seed mixtures can speed resistance evolution if larvae move among plants. Devising optimal management plans for deploying spatial refuges is difficult because they depend on crop rotation patterns, whether males or females have limited dispersal, and other characteristics. Nonetheless, the effects of spatial refuges on resistance evolution can be understood by considering the three mechanisms determining the rate of resistance evolution: the force of selection (the proportion of insects killed by Bt), assortative mating (deviations of the proportion of heterozygotes from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the total population level), and male mating success (when males carrying resistance alleles find fewer mates). Of these three, assortative mating is often the least important, even though this mechanism is the most frequently cited explanation for the efficacy of the high dose-refuge strategy.},

abstract = {To delay resistance development to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) plants expressing their own insecticide, the application of the Insect Resistance Management strategy called "High Dose/Refuge Strategy" (HD/R) is recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). This strategy was developed for Bt plants expressing one toxin. Presently, however, new Bt plants that simultaneously express two toxins are on the market. We used a mathematical model to evaluate the efficiency of the HD/R strategy for both these Bt toxins. As the current two-toxin Bt plants do not express two new Cry toxins but reuse one toxin already in use with a one-toxin plant, we estimated the spread of resistance when the resistance alleles are not rare. This study assesses: (i) whether the two toxins have to be present in high concentration, and (ii) the impact of the relative size of the refuge zone on the evolution of resistance and population density. We concluded that for Bt plants expressing one toxin, a high concentration is an essential condition for resistance management. For the pyramided Bt plants, one toxin could be expressed at a low titer if the two toxins are used for the first time, and a small refuge zone is acceptable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information is needed on the expected durability of insecticidal nets under operational conditions. The persistence of insecticidal efficacy is important to estimate the median serviceable life of nets under field conditions and to plan for net replacement. METHODS: Deltamethrin residue levels were evaluated by the proxy method of X-ray fluorescence spectrometry on 189 nets used for three to six months from nine sites, 220 nets used for 14-20 months from 11 sites, and 200 nets used for 26-32 months from ten sites in Ethiopia. A random sample of 16.5-20{\%} of nets from each time period (total 112 of 609 nets) were tested by bioassay with susceptible mosquitoes, and nets used for 14-20 months and 26-32 months were also tested with wild caught mosquitoes. RESULTS: Mean insecticide levels estimated by X-ray fluorescence declined by 25.9{\%} from baseline of 66.2 (SD 14.6) mg/m2 at three to six months to 44.1 (SD 21.2) mg/m2 at 14-20 months and by 30.8{\%} to 41.1 (SD 18.9) mg/m2 at 26-32 months. More than 95{\%} of nets retained greater than 10 mg/m2 of deltamethrin and over 79{\%} had at least 25 mg/m2 at all time periods. By bioassay with susceptible Anopheles, mortality averaged 89.0{\%} on 28 nets tested at three to six months, 93.3{\%} on 44 nets at 14-20 months and 94.1{\%} on 40 nets at 26-32 months. With wild caught mosquitoes, mortality averaged 85.4{\%} (range 79.1 to 91.7{\%}) at 14-20 months but had dropped significantly to 47.2{\%} (39.8 to 54.7{\%}) at 26-32 months. CONCLUSIONS: Insecticide residue level, as estimated by X-ray fluorescence, declined by about one third between three and six months and 14-20 months, but remained relatively stable and above minimum requirements thereafter up to 26-32 months. The insecticidal activity of PermaNet(R) 2.0 long-lasting insecticidal nets in the specified study area may be considered effective to susceptible mosquitoes at least for the duration indicated in this study (32 months). However, results indicated that resistance in the wild population is already rendering nets with optimum insecticide concentrations less effective in practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With high DDT resistance present throughout much of West Africa, carbamates and organophosphates are increasingly important alternatives to pyrethroids for indoor residual spraying (IRS). Though less widespread, resistance to both of these alternative insecticide classes has also been documented within the Anopheles gambiae species pair (formerly the M and S molecular forms) in West Africa. To manage insecticide efficacy, it is important to predict how and where resistance is likely to occur and spread, which could be aided by using molecular diagnostics with high predictive value.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were collected from 18 sites throughout southern Ghana and bioassayed with bendiocarb, the most commonly applied carbamate, and an organophosphate, fenitrothion. The Ace-1 target site substitution G119S was genotyped by qPCR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Fenitrothion induced higher mortality than bendiocarb, though phenotypes correlated strongly across populations. Ace-1 119S was found at much higher frequency in An. gambiae s.s than An. coluzzii, exceeding 90{\%} in a population from Greater Accra, the highest frequency reported to date. Ace-1 G119S was very strongly associated with resistance to both insecticides, providing high predictive power for diagnosis, though with some evidence for a differential effect between molecular forms for bendiocarb. Sequencing of the gene revealed a lack of variation in resistant alleles precluding determination of origin, but Ace-1 copy number variation was detected for the first time in Ghana.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results validate G119S as a useful diagnostic of organophosphate and carbamate resistance within and among populations, whilst highlighting the potential for an aggregate nature of Ace-1 genotypes, which may comprise both single-copy and duplicated genes. Further work is now required to determine the distribution and resistance-association of Ace-1 duplication.},

abstract = {Abstract. A new approach is proposed in the treatment of mosquito nets, using a `two-in-one' combination of pyrethroid and non-pyrethroid insecticides applied to different parts of bednets. The objectives are mainly to overcome certain limitations of pyrethroid-impregnated bednets currently recommended for malaria control purposes. Apart from developing alternatives to pyrethroid dependency, we sought to counteract pyrethroid irritant effects on mosquitoes (excito-repellency) and resistance to pyrethroids. The idea takes advantage of the presumed host-seeking behaviour of mosquitoes confronted by a net draped over a bed, whereby the mosquito may explore the net from the top downwards. Thus, nets could be more effective if treated on the upper part with residual non-irritant insecticide (carbamate or organophosphate) and with a pyrethroid on the lower part. Sequential exposure to different insecticides with distinct modes of action is equivalent to the use of a mixture as a potential method of managing insecticide resistance. We also intended to improve the control of nuisance mosquitoes, especially Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) that often survive pyrethroids, in order to encourage public compliance with use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Polyester bednets were pretreated with residual pyrethroid (bifenthrin 50 mg/m2 or deltamethrin 25 mg/m2) on the lower half and with carbamate (carbosulfan 300 mg/m2) on the upper half to minimize contact with net users. Unreplicated examples of these `two-in-one' treated nets were {\textregistered}eld-tested against wild mosquitoes, in comparison with an untreated net and bednets treated with each insecticide alone, including PermaNetTM wash-resistant formulation of deltamethrin 50 mg/m2. Overnight tests involved volunteers sleeping under the experimental bednets in verandah-trap huts at Yaoko{\textregistered}kro, near Bouake{\^{A}} in Co{\~{A}} te d'Ivoire, where the main malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles, as well as Culex quinquefasciatus Say, are highly resistant to pyrethroids. Ef{\textregistered}cacy of these ITNs was assessed in the huts by four entomological criteria: deterrency and induced exophily (effects on hut entry and exit), blood-feeding and mortality rates (immediate and delayed). Overall, the best impact was achieved by the bednet treated with carbosulfan alone, followed by `two-in-one' treatments with carbosulfan plus pyrethroid. Blood-feeding rates were 13{\%} An. gambiae and 17{\%} Cx. quinquefasciatus in huts with untreated nets, but only 3{\%} with carbosulfan ITNs, 7±11{\%} with combined},

abstract = {Experimental huts in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire were used to evaluate the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin, the non-ester pyrethroid etofenprox, the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl and the carbamate carbosulfan on bednets against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae Giles. To test for selection for the resistance gene by the treated nets, A. gambiae collected live or dead from the huts were kept and analysed for the presence of the kdr gene using a new polymerase chain reaction followed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing (PCR-SSOP) for kdr-genotyping. Deliberately holed bednets freshly treated with pirimiphos-methyl or carbosulfan caused over 90{\%} kill of A. gambiae s.s. and Culex spp. However, the mortality with alpha-cypermethrin or etofenprox treated nets was similar to that with untreated nets. Bloodfeeding of A. gambiae s.s. on the sleepers under the nets was only significantly reduced by alpha-cypermethrin and carbosulfan. Tests of the residual activity of the bednets after seven months showed that pirimiphos-methyl had lost its efficacy while carbosulfan still performed well. Once again the pyrethroid treated nets gave similar results to the untreated nets. Selection for the kdr-allele by alpha-cypermethrin and etofenprox, but not by carbosulfan, was indicated by PCR-SSOP genotyping of mosquitoes. Thus carbamates such as carbosulfan, or organophosphates of longer persistence than pirimiphos-methyl and of low mammalian toxicity, would seem to be a promising alternative to be used on bednets, particularly in areas of pyrethroid resistance.},

An LN containing PPF alone and a classic Olyset(R) Net were tested in parallel as positive controls. The effect of progressive number of holes (6, 30, or 150) that may accrue in nets over time was simulated. We used two laboratory Anopheles gambiae s.s. strains: the susceptible Kisumu strain and the pyrethroid-resistant VK-Per strain having solely kdr as resistance mechanism. The effect of these nets on the reproductive success of blood-fed females that survived the different LNs conditions was recorded. Regardless of the mosquito strain, the LNs containing PPF alone with as many as 30 holes drastically reduced the number of eggs laid by females succeeding in feeding, i.e. fecundity by 98{\%} and egg hatching rate (fertility) by 93{\%} relative to untreated control net. Very few of the resistant females blood fed and survived under the Olyset(R) Duo with similar number of holes (up to 30) but of these few, the inhibition of reproductive success was 100{\%}. There was no evidence that the Olyset(R) Duo LN with 150 holes impacted fecundity or fertility of the resistant colony. The efficacy of Olyset(R) Duo is encouraging and clearly illustrates that this new net might be a promising tool for malaria transmission control and resistance management.},

abstract = {Computational simulation models can provide a way of understanding and predicting insect population dynamics and evolution of resistance, but the usefulness of such models depends on generating or estimating the values of key parameters. In this paper, we describe four numerical algorithms generating or estimating key parameters for simulating four different processes within such models. First, we describe a novel method to generate an offspring genotype table for one- or two-locus genetic models for simulating evolution of resistance, and how this method can be extended to create offspring genotype tables for models with more than two loci. Second, we describe how we use a generalized inverse matrix to find a least-squares solution to an over-determined linear system for estimation of parameters in probit models of kill rates. This algorithm can also be used for the estimation of parameters of Freundlich adsorption isotherms. Third, we describe a simple algorithm to randomly select initial frequencies of genotypes either without any special constraints or with some pre-selected frequencies. Also we give a simple method to calculate the " stable" Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions that would result from these initial frequencies. Fourth we describe how the problem of estimating the intrinsic rate of natural increase of a population can be converted to a root-finding problem and how the bisection algorithm can then be used to find the rate. We implemented all these algorithms using MATLAB and Python code; the key statements in both codes consist of only a few commands and are given in the appendices. The results of numerical experiments are also provided to demonstrate that our algorithms are valid and efficient. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The type of sprayable surface impacts on residual efficacy of insecticide used in indoor residual spraying (IRS). However, there is limited data on common types of wall surfaces sprayed in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania where IRS began in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The study investigated residual efficacy of micro-encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin sprayed on common surfaces of human dwellings and domestic animal shelters in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. METHODS: An experimental hut was constructed with different types of materials simulating common sprayable surfaces in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. Surfaces included cement plastered wall, mud-daub, white-wash, wood, palm-thatch, galvanized iron-sheets, burnt-bricks, limestone and oil-paint. The World Health Organization (WHO) procedure for IRS was used to spray lambda-cyhalothrin on surfaces at the dose of 20-25 mg/m(2). Residual efficacy of insecticide was monitored through cone bioassay using laboratory-reared mosquitoes; Kisumu strain (R-70) of Anopheles gambiae ss. Cone bioassay was done every fortnight for a period of 152 days. The WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) threshold (80{\%} mortality) was used as cut-off point for acceptable residual efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 5,800 mosquitoes were subjected to contact cone bioassay to test residual efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin. There was a statistically significant variation in residual efficacy between the different types of wall surfaces (r = 0.24; p {\textless} 0.001). Residual efficacy decreased with increasing pH of the substrate (r = -0.5; p {\textless} 0.001). Based on WHOPES standards, shorter residual efficacy (42-56 days) was found in wall substrates made of cement, limestone, mud-daub, oil paint and white wash. Burnt bricks retained the residual efficacy up to 134 days while galvanized iron sheets, palm thatch and wood retained the recommended residual efficacy beyond 152 days. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a wide variation in residual efficacy of micro encapsulated formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin across the different types of wall surfaces studied. In areas where malaria transmission is bimodal and wall surfaces with short residual efficacy comprise {\textgreater} 20{\%} of sprayable structures, two rounds of IRS using lambda-cyhalothrin should be considered. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of sprayable surfaces on residual efficacy of other insecticides commonly used for IRS in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.},

abstract = {Resistance management for insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) remains a challenge. Options are limited, because a safe and highly active insecticide with a persistence of several months is required. These criteria have only been met by pyrethroids, although organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates have been considered as alternatives for impregnation of eave curtains. It has been observed that some pyrethroid-resistant mosquito strains show increased OP susceptibility over pyrethroid-susceptible strains (i.e., negative cross-resistance). The current study investigated whether this phenomenon applies to a range of mosquito species and strains, because a mixture or rotation strategy for resistance management could then be envisaged. Adult female mosquitoes from laboratory strains of Anopheles stephensi Liston, Anopheles gambiae Giles, and Culex quinquefasciatus Say were tested in World Health Organization susceptibility test kits. For An. stephensi, the highly pyrethroid-resistant DUB 234 strain showed the same level of resistance to malathion as the pyrethroid-susceptible DUB S. The malathion-resistant ST MAL strain was as susceptible to pyrethroids as the insecticide-susceptible BEECH. For An. gambiae, the malathion tolerance of the previously pyrethroid-resistant RSP strain was significantly higher than that of the insecticide-susceptible KWA. For Cx. quinquefasciatus, selection of the QUINQ strain with permethrin abolished preexisting resistance to the OP malathion as pyrethroid resistance increased, rendering the strain more susceptible to malathion than PEL SS. Some indication of negative cross-resistance to malathion was found for the permethrin-resistant MUHEZA strain. The occurrence of negative cross-resistance seems dependent on the history of insecticide selection and is not generally applicable. Resistance management for ITNs will need to use mechanisms other than negative cross-resistance to be effective.},

abstract = {Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for malaria control are widespread but coverage remains inadequate. We developed a Bayesian model using data from 102 national surveys, triangulated against delivery data and distribution reports, to generate year-by-year estimates of four ITN coverage indicators. We explored the impact of two potential 'inefficiencies': uneven net distribution among households and rapid rates of net loss from households. We estimated that, in 2013, 21{\%} (17{\%}-26{\%}) of ITNs were over-allocated and this has worsened over time as overall net provision has increased. We estimated that rates of ITN loss from households are more rapid than previously thought, with 50{\%} lost after 23 (20-28) months. We predict that the current estimate of 920 million additional ITNs required to achieve universal coverage would in reality yield a lower level of coverage (77{\%} population access). By improving efficiency, however, the 920 million ITNs could yield population access as high as 95{\%}.},

abstract = {Anopheles culicifacies that were susceptible, heterozygous, or homozygous resistant to HCH and dieldrin were differentially marked with fluorescent dusts and released twice weekly into village huts in Pakistan that had been sprayed with four different dosages of HCH to see which of the genotypes died and which survived. The three highest dosages killed all three genotypes in the first four weeks, and heterozygotes and susceptibles for at least 12 weeks. The lowest dosage killed all the susceptibles throughout the period, and all but 0.07{\%} of the heterzygotes. Thus the resistance is effectively recessive at the higher dosages and unlikely to be selected rapidly, as long as the gene frequency is low to start with and the houses are sprayed regularly. Similar releases of partially and completely resistant A. stephensi, and completely resistant A. subpictus, showed greater survival rates on exposure to the high HCH dosages than the same genotypes of A. culicifacies.},

abstract = {Effects of knockdown resistance (kdr) were investigated in three pyrethroid-resistant (RR) strains of the Afrotropical mosquito Anopheles gambiae Giles (Diptera: Culicidae): Kou from Burkina Faso, Tola and Yao from Cote d'Ivoire; compared with a standard susceptible (SS) strain from Kisumu, Kenya. The kdr factor was incompletely recessive, conferring 43-fold resistance ratio at LD50 level and 29-fold at LD95 level, as determined by topical application tests with Kou strain. When adult mosquitoes were exposed to 0.25{\%} permethrin-impregnated papers, the 50{\%} and 95{\%} knockdown times (KdT) were 23 and 42 min for SS females, compared with 40 and 62 min for RS (F1 Kou x Kisumu) females. On 1{\%} permethrin the KdT50 and KdT95 were 11 and 21 min for SS compared with 18 and 33 min for RS females. Following 1 h exposure to permethrin (0.25{\%} or 1{\%}), no significant knockdown of Kou RR females occurred within 24 h. Permethrin irritancy to An. gambiae was assessed by comparing 'time to first take-off' (TO) for females. The standard TO50 and TO95 values for Kisumu SS on untreated paper were 58 and 1044 s, respectively, vs. 3.7 and 16.5 s on 1{\%} permethrin. For Kou RR females the comparable values were 27.3 s for TO50 and 294 s for TO95, with intermediate RS values of 10.1 s for TO50 and 71.9 s for TO95. Thus, TO values for RS were 2.7-4.4 times more than for SS, and those for RR were 7-18 times longer than for SS. Experiments with pyrethroid-impregnated nets were designed to induce hungry female mosquitoes to pass through holes cut in the netting. Laboratory 'tunnel tests' used a bait guinea-pig to attract mosquitoes through circular holes (5 x 1 cm) in a net screen. With untreated netting, 75-83{\%} of laboratory-reared females passed through the holes overnight, 63-69{\%} blood-fed successfully and 9-17{\%} died, with no significant differences between SS and RR genotypes. When the netting was treated with permethrin 250mg ai/m2 the proportions that passed through the holes overnight were only 10{\%} of SS vs. 40-46{\%} of RR (Tola {\&} Kou); mortality rates were 100{\%} of SS compared with 59-82{\%} of RR; bloodmeals were obtained by 9{\%} of Kou RR and 17{\%} of Tola RR, but none of the Kisumu SS females. When the net was treated with deltamethrin 25 mg ai/m2 the proportions of An. gambiae that went through the holes and blood-fed successfully were 3.9{\%} of Kisumu SS and 3.5{\%} of Yaokoffikro field population (94{\%} R). Mortality rates were 97{\%} of Kisumu SS vs. 47{\%} of Yaokoffikro R. Evidently this deltamethrin treatment was sufficient to kill nearly all SS and half of the Yaokoffikro R An. gambiae population despite its high kdr frequency. Experimental huts at Yaokoffikro were used for overnight evaluation of bednets against An. gambiae females. The huts were sealed to prevent egress of mosquitoes released at 20.00 hours and collected at 05.00 hours. Each net was perforated with 225 square holes (2 x 2 cm). A man slept under the net as bait. With untreated nets, only 4-6{\%} of mosquitoes died overnight and bloodmeals were taken by 17{\%} of SS vs. 29{\%} of Yaokoffikro R (P{\textless}0.05). Nets treated with permethrin 500 mg/m2 caused mortality rates of 95{\%} Kisumu SS and 45{\%} Yao R (P{\textless}0.001) and blood-feeding rates were reduced to 1.3{\%} of SS vs. 8.1{\%} of Yao R (P{\textless}0.05). Nets treated with deltamethrin 25 mg/m2 caused mortality rates of 91{\%} Kisumu SS and 54{\%} Yao R (P{\textless}0.001) and reduced blood-feeding rates to zero for SS vs. 2.5{\%} for Yao R (P{\textgreater}0.05).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa with considerable burden for human health. Major insecticide resistance mechanisms such as kdr (R) and ace-1 (R) alleles constitute a hindrance to malaria vector control programs. Anopheles gambiae bearing both kdr and ace-1 resistant alleles are increasingly recorded in wild populations. In order to maintain the efficacy of vector control strategies, the characterization of concomitant kdr and ace-1 resistance, and their pleiotropic effects on malaria vector phenotype on insecticide efficacy are important. METHODS: Larval and adult bioassays were performed with different insecticide classes used in public health following WHO standard guidelines on four laboratory Anopheles gambiae strains, sharing the same genetic background but harboring distinct resistance status: KISUMU with no resistance allele; ACERKIS with ace-1 (R) allele; KISKDR with kdr (R) allele and ACERKDRKIS with both resistance alleles' ace-1 (R) and kdr (R) . RESULTS: Larval bioassays indicate that the homozygote resistant strain harboring both alleles (ACERKDRKIS) displayed slightly but significantly higher resistance level to various insecticides like carbamates (bendiocarb, p {\textless} 0.001; propoxur, p = 0.02) and organophosphates (chlorpyriphos-methyl, p = 0.002; fenitrothion, p {\textless} 0.001) when compared to ACERKIS strain. However, no differences were recorded between ACERKDRKIS and KISKDR resistance level against permethrin (Pyrethroid, p = 0.7) and DDT (Organochlorine, p = 0.24). For adult bioassays, the percentages of mosquitoes knocked down were significantly lower for ACERKDRKIS than for KISKDR with permethrin (p = 0.003) but not with deltamethrin. The percentage of mortality from adult bioassays was similar between ACERKDRKIS and ACERKIS with carbamates and organophosphates, or between ACERKDRKIS and KISKDR with pyrethroid and DDT. Concerning acetylcholinesterase enzyme, ACERKDRKIS strain showed similarAChE1 activity than that of ACERKIS. CONCLUSION: The presence of both kdr (R) and ace-1 (R) alleles seems to increase the resistance levels to both carbamate and organophosphate insecticides and at operational level, may represent an important threat to malaria vector control programs in West Africa.},

It is important to identify alternative insecticides which, if necessary, could be used to replace or supplement the pyrethroids for use on treated nets. Certain compounds of an earlier generation of insecticides, the organophosphates may have potential as net treatments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Comparative studies of chlorpyrifos-methyl (CM), an organophosphate with low mammalian toxicity, and lambdacyhalothrin (L), a pyrethroid, were conducted in experimental huts in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire, West Africa. Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes from the area are resistant to pyrethroids and organophosphates (kdr and insensitive acetylcholinesterase Ace.1R). Several treatments and application rates on intact or holed nets were evaluated, including single treatments, mixtures, and differential wall/ceiling treatments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: All of the treatments were effective in reducing blood feeding from sleepers under the nets and in killing both species of mosquito, despite the presence of the kdr and Ace.1R genes at high frequency. In most cases, the effects of the various treatments did not differ significantly. Five washes of the nets in soap solution did not reduce the impact of the insecticides on A. gambiae mortality, but did lead to an increase in blood feeding. The three combinations performed no differently from the single insecticide treatments, but the low dose mixture performed encouragingly well indicating that such combinations might be used for controlling insecticide resistant mosquitoes. Mortality of mosquitoes that carried both Ace.1R and Ace.1S genes did not differ significantly from mosquitoes that carried only Ace.1S genes on any of the treated nets, indicating that the Ace.1R allele does not confer effective resistance to chlorpyrifos-methyl under the realistic conditions of an experimental hut.},

However, several recent papers have concluded that the knockdown resistance (kdr) genotype-phenotype correlation that is observed in a wide variety of taxa might not hold in all mosquitoes. In this article, we review the evidence to support this putative breakdown and argue that the conclusion follows from unreliable data or the unparsimonious interpretation of data. We assert that the link between kdr genotype and DDT- and pyrethroid-susceptibility phenotype is clear. However, we emphasize that kdr genotype might explain only a portion of heritable variation in resistance and that diagnostic assays to test the importance of other resistance mechanisms in field populations are required. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The evolution of pesticide and drug resistance plagues agriculture and medicine worldwide. Resistance may stem from a single major gene or from quantitative sources, and both have been observed in the same species. The genetic basis of resistance plays a key role in treatment, as low concentrations facilitate the evolution of quantitative resistance, while high concentrations select for the rapid appearance of major gene resistance. When crop rotation or pesticide rotation is unfeasible (e.g. orchard crops or cross resistance to multiple pesticides), the authors propose and model a strategy of rotating low and high concentrations in alternate treatments. This strategy should delay resistance and extend pest control longer than using a series of constant low or high concentrations. The model framework was modified to investigate whether inducible (compared with constitutive) defence may also slow the evolution of pest resistance to plant secondary compounds, with possible implications for genetic engineering of pest resistant crops. The model led to predictions that plants with inducible defenses supported pests that evolved resistance more slowly than plants with constitutive defenses, suggesting that natural selection has favoured a strategy similar to pesticide concentration rotation.},

The overarching goal is to use the knowledge gained to support adaptation and mitigation decisions that require regional or global perspectives within the context of facilitating transformations to enable sustainable development, despite inevitable climate shifts and disruptions. ISIMIP uses community-agreed sets of scenarios with standardized climate variables and socio-economic projections as inputs for projecting future risks and associated uncertainties, within and across sectors. The results are consistent multi-model assessments of sectoral risks and opportunities that enable studies that integrate across sectors, providing support for implementation of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Current interventions against malaria have significantly reduced the number of people infected and the number of deaths. Concerns about emerging resistance of both mosquitoes and parasites to intervention have been raised, and questions remain about how best to generate wider knowledge of the underlying evolutionary processes. The pedagogical and research principles of evolutionary medicine may provide an answer to this problem. METHODS Eight programme managers and five academic researchers were interviewed by telephone or videoconference to elicit their first-hand views and experiences of malaria control given that evolution is a constant threat to sustainable control. Interviewees were asked about their views on the relationship between practit groups and academics and for their thoughts on whether or not evolutionary medicine may provide a solution to reported tensions. RESULTS There was broad agreement that evolution of both parasites and vectors presents an obstacle to sustainable control. It was also widely agreed that through more efficient monitoring, evolution could be widely monitored. Interviewees also expressed the view that even well planned interventions may fail if the evolutionary biology of the disease is not considered, potentially making current tools redundant. CONCLUSIONS This scoping study suggests that it is important to make research, including evolutionary principles, available and easily applicable for programme managers and key decision-makers, including donors and politicians. The main conclusion is that sharing knowledge through the educational and research processes embedded within evolutionary medicine has potential to relieve tensions and facilitate sustainable control of malaria and other parasitic infections.},

abstract = {Abbott's formula may be used to correct bioassay data for control response and has become a standard in bioassay evaluation. Although Abbott's formula provides an estimate of p{\_} (the mean bioassay treatment response corrected for control response), it does not provide a measure of associated variance. The current practice of retaining the variance estimate for p.", (the mean bioassay treatment response not corrected for control response) and applying it to p{\_} is invalid. This invalid procedure results in an exaggeration of the reliability of the estimate of p{\_} and a confidence interval for PCIm' that is centered around an inappropriate value.We present a technique to incorporate a correction for control response into the statistical analysisof bioassaysconducted with only a single or small number of treatments, which may be qualitative classesrather than a series of doses. The proposed solutionisbased upon established techniques for estimating the variance or confidenceinterval of a ratio of normally distributed variables.The analysissuggeststwo implications for bioassay experimental design and evaluation: first, the optimal allocation of bioassay replications to control and experimental treatments generally occurs when the number of experimental replications is equal to or slightly greater than the number of control replications, and second, bioassay data should be corrected for control mortality more frequently than is currently recommended. Only if such a correction has negligible effects on both p{\_} and Var(p{\_}) can it be safely omitted.},

abstract = {Although theoretical studies have shown that the mixture strategy, which uses multiple toxins simultaneously, can effectively delay the evolution of insecticide resistance, whether it is the optimal management strategy under different insect life histories and insecticide types remains unknown. To test the robustness of this management strategy over different life histories, we developed a series of simulation models that cover almost all the diploid insect types and have the same basic structure describing pest population dynamics and resistance evolution with discrete time steps. For each of two insecticidal toxins, independent one-locus two-allele autosomal inheritance of resistance was assumed. The simulations demonstrated the optimality of the mixture strategy either when insecticide efficacy was incomplete or when some part of the population disperses between patches before mating. The rotation strategy, which uses one insecticide on one pest generation and a different one on the next, did not differ from sequential usage in the time to resistance, except when dominance was low. It was the optimal strategy when insecticide efficacy was high and premating selection and dispersal occur.},

The resulting data allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of response, including two features of particular interest: (i) the relative contribution of autosomal and sex-linked genes and whether any significant Y chromosome or cytoplasmic effects were present (ii) the mechanism of gene action, whether predominantly additive or whether significant dominance effects were present. A large additive sex-linked effect was observed in lines selected on body weight which accounted for approximately 25{\%} of the divergence. The remaining 75{\%} of the divergence appeared to be autosomal. There was no apparent sex-linked effect in lines selected on fat content and the response appeared to be entirely autosomal and additive.},

abstract = {Vector control using long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) accounts for most of the malaria burden reductions achieved recently in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). LLINs and IRS are highly effective, but are insufficient to eliminate malaria transmission in many settings because of operational constraints, growing resistance to available insecticides and mosquitoes that behaviourally avoid contact with these interventions. However, a number of substantive opportunities now exist for rapidly developing and implementing more diverse, effective and sustainable malaria vector control strategies for LMICs. For example, mosquito control in high-income countries is predominantly achieved with a combination of mosquito-proofed housing and environmental management, supplemented with large-scale insecticide applications to larval habitats and outdoor spaces that kill off vector populations en masse, but all these interventions remain underused in LMICs. Programmatic development and evaluation of decentralised, locally managed systems for delivering these proactive mosquito population abatement practices in LMICs could therefore enable broader scale-up. Furthermore, a diverse range of emerging or repurposed technologies are becoming available for targeting mosquitoes when they enter houses, feed outdoors, attack livestock, feed on sugar or aggregate into mating swarms. Global policy must now be realigned to mobilise the political and financial support necessary to exploit these opportunities over the decade ahead, so that national malaria control and elimination programmes can access a much broader, more effective set of vector control interventions.},

abstract = {A customized geographical information system (GIS) has been developed to support focal indoor residual spraying (IRS) operations as part of a scaled-up campaign to progressively eliminate malaria in Vanuatu. The aims of the GISbased spatial decision support system (SDSS) were to guide the planning, implementation and assessment of IRS at the household level. Additional aims of this study were to evaluate the user acceptability of a SDSS guiding IRS interventions. IRS was conducted on Tanna Island, Republic of Vanuatu between 26 October and 5 December 2009. Geo-referenced household information provided a baseline within the SDSS. An interactive mapping interface was used to delineate operation areas, extract relevant data to support IRS field teams. In addition, it was used as a monitoring tool to assess overall intervention coverage. Surveys and group discussions were conducted during the operations to ascertain user acceptability. Twenty-one operation areas, comprising a total of 187 settlements and 3,422 households were identified and mapped. A total of 3,230 households and 12,156 household structures were sprayed, covering a population of 13,512 individuals, achieving coverage of 94.4{\%} of the households and 95.7{\%} of the population. Village status maps were produced to visualize the distribution of IRS at the sub-village level. One hundred percent of survey respondents declared the SDSS a useful and effective tool to support IRS. The GIS-based SDSS adopted in Tanna empowered programme managers at the provincial level to implement and asses the IRS intervention with the degree of detail required for malaria elimination. Since completion, SDSS applications have expanded to additional provinces in Vanuatu and the neighbouring Solomon Islands supporting not only specific malaria elimination and control interventions, but also the broader public health sector in general.},

METHODS: We used freely accessible satellite imagery and a set of feature-making tools included in the software (allowing for production of polygons, lines and points) to generate information for city infrastructure and to display disease data in a dengue decision support system (DDSS) framework. FINDINGS: Two cities in Mexico (Chetumal and Merida) were used to demonstrate that a basic representation of city infrastructure useful as a spatial backbone in a DDSS can be rapidly developed at minimal cost. Data layers generated included labelled polygons representing city blocks, lines representing streets, and points showing the locations of schools and health clinics. City blocks were colour-coded to show presence of dengue cases. The data layers were successfully imported in a format known as shapefile into a GIS software. CONCLUSION: The combination of Google Earth and free GIS software (e.g. HealthMapper, developed by WHO, and SIGEpi, developed by PAHO) has tremendous potential to strengthen overall public health capacity and facilitate decision support system approaches to prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments.},

abstract = {Guidelines from the World Health Organization for monitoring insecticide resistance in disease vectors recommend exposing insects to a predetermined discriminating dose of insecticide and recording the percentage mortality in the population. This standardized methodology has been widely adopted for malaria vectors and has provided valuable data on the spread and prevalence of resistance. However, understanding the potential impact of this resistance on malaria control requires a more quantitative measure of the strength or intensity of this resistance. Bioassays were adapted to quantify the level of resistance to permethrin in laboratory colonies and field populations of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato. WHO susceptibility tube assays were used to produce data on mortality versus exposure time and CDC bottle bioassays were used to generate dose response data sets. A modified version of the CDC bottle bioassay, known as the Resistance Intensity Rapid Diagnostic Test (I-RDT), was also used to measure the knockdown and mortality after exposure to different multipliers of the diagnostic dose. Finally cone bioassays were used to assess mortality after exposure to insecticide treated nets. The time response assays were simple to perform but not suitable for highly resistant populations. After initial problems with stability of insecticide and bottle washing were resolved, the CDC bottle bioassay provided a reproducible, quantitative measure of resistance but there were challenges performing this under field conditions. The I-RDT was simple to perform and interpret although the end point selected (immediate knockdown versus 24 h mortality) could dramatically affect the interpretation of the data. The utility of the cone bioassays was dependent on net type and thus appropriate controls are needed to interpret the operational significance of these data sets. Incorporating quantitative measures of resistance strength, and utilizing bioassays with field doses of insecticides, will help interpret the possible impact of resistance on vector control activities. Each method tested had different benefits and challenges and agreement on a common methodology would be beneficial so that data are generated in a standardized format. This type of quantitative data are an important prerequisite to linking resistance strength to epidemiological outcomes.},

abstract = {Insecticides play an integral role in the control of mosquito-borne diseases. With resistance to insecticides on the rise, surveillance of the target population for optimal choice of insecticides is a necessity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle assay and the World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility test are the most frequently used methods in insecticide resistance monitoring. However, the two bioassays differ in terms of insecticide delivery and how insecticide susceptibility is measured. To evaluate how equivalent data from the two assays are, we compared the two methods side-by-side. We did a literature search from 1998 to December 2014 to identify publications that performed both assays on the same mosquito population and compared the results. We then tested the WHO and CDC bioassays on laboratory strains of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis with different insecticide resistance levels against permethrin, $\lambda$-cyhalothrin, DDT, bendiocarb and malathion. In addition, we also measured the relationship between time-to-knockdown and 24 h mortality. Both published data and results from the present laboratory experiments showed heterogeneity in the comparability of the two bioassays. Following their standard procedures, the two assays showed poor agreement in detecting resistance at the WHO cut-off mark of 90 {\%} (Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.06). There was better agreement when 24 h mortality was recorded in the CDC bottle assay and compared with that of the WHO susceptibility test (Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.5148). Time-to-knockdown was shown to be an unreliable predictor of 24 h mortality. Even though the two assays can detect insecticide resistance, they may not be used interchangeably. While the diagnostic dose in the WHO susceptibility test does not allow for detecting shifts at low or extreme resistance levels, time-to-knockdown measured in the CDC bottle assay is a poor predictor of 24 h mortality. Therefore, dose–response assays could provide the most flexibility. New standardized bioassays are needed that produce consistent dose–response measurements with a minimal number of mosquitoes.},

@article{Gardner1998,
abstract = {The evolution of pesticide and drug resistance presents a daunting problem as the pests often evolve resistance after a short time. Debate once focused on whether resistance stems primarily from single major gene sources or sequential accumulation of quantitative traits. Such debates became moot, as examples of both are known, even within the same species and population. The type of resistance has important implications for determining the dosages that will delay the appearance of resistant populations. Successive high doses of a toxin (i.e. those well above the LD99) can only select for monogenic resistance, while the weaker selection pressure of low (near lethal) doses can also result in an incremental increase in quantitative changes leading to increasingly higher levels of resistance. We propose and use a model to mathematically test whether a revolving rotation of a series of low doses periodically alternated with a higher dose could delay the evolution of resistance longer than by applying a constant dose (either low or high) in every treatment. We suggest this dosage rotation strategy for situations in which crops and alternative pesticides or drugs cannot be rotated, and suggest that it be used in conjunction with other methods of control (biocontrol, IPM) to further delay resistance. We model the evolution of resistance under truncation selection (more typical in the laboratory), as well as under a smooth selection regime that is more likely to describe selection in the field where pests develop more asynchronously, and application is less uniform. In addition, we consider the level of population control imposed by the toxin, since, for economic and health reasons, both the size of the pest population as well as the frequency of resistant pests must be considered. We also examine how the degree of dominance of the major resistance gene and changes in heritability with repeated episodes of selection affect the success of dosage rotation compared with constant doses. Modelled dosage rotations could delay resistance and suppress pest populations longer and require less pesticide (or drug) than successive constant doses. Constant doses may suffice to delay resistance over the short run if heritability is low, but revolving doses are essential over longer periods. The modelled results seem worthy of field validation, as they predict a longer resistance-free period at the lowest possible doses.},

abstract = {Chagas disease is a chronic parasitic infection restricted to America. The disease is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to human through the feces of infected triatomine insects. Because no treatment is available for the chronic forms of the disease, vector chemical control represents the best way to reduce the incidence of the disease. Chemical control has been based principally on spraying dwellings with insecticide formulations and led to the reduction of triatomine distribution and consequent interruption of disease transmission in several areas from endemic region. However, in the last decade it has been repeatedly reported the presence triatomnes, mainly Triatoma infestans, after spraying with pyrethroid insecticides, which was associated to evolution to insecticide resistance. In this paper the evolution of insecticide resistance in triatomines is reviewed. The insecticide resistance was detected in 1970s in Rhodnius prolixus and 1990s in R. prolixus and T. infestans, but not until the 2000s resistance to pyrthroids in T. infestans associated to control failures was described in Argentina and Bolivia. The main resistance mechanisms (i.e. enhanced metabolism, altered site of action and reduced penetration) were described in the T. infestans resistant to pyrethrods. Different resistant profiles were demonstrated suggesting independent origin of the different resistant foci of Argentina and Bolivia. The deltamethrin resistance in T. infestans was showed to be controlled by semi-dominant, autosomally inherited factors. Reproductive and developmental costs were also demonstrated for the resistant T. infestans. A discussion about resistance and tolerance concepts and the persistence of T. infestans in Gran Chaco region are presented. In addition, theoretical concepts related to toxicological, evolutionary and ecological aspects of insecticide resistance are discussed in order to understand the particular scenario of pyrethroid resistance in triatomines.},

abstract = {We develop a flexible, two-locus model for the spread of insecticide resistance applicable to mosquito species that transmit human diseases such as malaria. The model allows differen-tial exposure of males and females, allows them to encounter high or low concentrations of insecticide, and allows selection pressures and dominance values to differ depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. We demonstrate its application by investigat-ing the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture to minimise the spread of resistance. We recover previously published results as subsets of this model and conduct a sensitivity analysis over an extensive parameter space to identify what circumstances favour mixtures over sequences. Both strategies lasted more than 500 mosquito generations (or about 40 years) in 24{\%} of runs, while in those runs where resis-tance had spread to high levels by 500 generations, 56{\%} favoured sequential use and 44{\%} favoured mixtures. Mixtures are favoured when insecticide effectiveness (their ability to kill homozygous susceptible mosquitoes) is high and exposure (the proportion of mosquitoes that encounter the insecticide) is low. If insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous sensitive genotypes, it is likely that sequential deployment will be a more robust strategy. Resistance to an insecticide always spreads slower if that insecticide is used in a mixture although this may be insufficient to outperform sequential use: for example, a mixture may last 5 years while the two insecticides deployed individually may last 3 and 4 years giving an overall 'life-span' of 7 years for sequential use. We emphasise that this paper is primarily about design-ing and implementing a flexible modelling strategy to investigate the spread of insecticide resistance in vector populations and demonstrate how our model can identify vector control strategies most likely to minimise the spread of insecticide resistance.},

Surprisingly, there is little consensus on how to combine selection pressures (i.e., molecules used in the treatment of pests or pathogens) over space and time to delay or prevent this evolutionary process. By reviewing theoretical models and experimental studies, we show that higher levels of heterogeneity of selection are associated with longer-term sustainability of pest or pathogen control. The combination of molecules usually outcompetes other resistance management strategies, such as Responsive alternation, Periodic application, or Mosaic, because it ensures 'multiple intragenerational killing'. A strategic deployment over space and/or time of several combinations can ensure 'multiple intergenerational killing', further delaying the evolution of resistance.},

Whether resistance detected across the landscape reflects ongoing de novo evolution in different hotspots or spread from a single focal population can determine the most effective mitigation strategy. Pest dispersal dynamics determine the spatio-temporal scale at which mitigation tactics must be applied to contain or reverse resistance in an area. Independent evolution of resistance in different populations appears common but not universal. Conversely, spatial spread appears to be almost inevitable. However, rate and scale of spread depends largely on dispersal dynamics and interplay with factors such as fitness costs, spatially variable selection pressure and whether resistance alleles are spreading through an established population or being carried by populations colonizing new territory.},

We focus on understanding principles and potential effectiveness from the perspective of evolutionary biology. This offers useful insights into mechanisms through which potential problems may be minimized, in much the same way that an understanding of how resistance evolves is key to slowing the spread of antibiotic and insecticide resistance. We conclude that there is much to gain from applying principles from the study of resistance in these other scenarios - specifically, the adoption of combinatorial approaches to minimize the spread of resistance evolution.

Rotation was superior to use of mixtures (at half the recommended field rate of each insecticide) in retarding resistance, and both treatments were better than sequential use.

abstract = {The prospect of malaria eradication has been raised recently by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with support from the international community. There are significant lessons to be learned from the major successes and failures of the eradication campaign of the 1960s, but cessation of transmission in the malaria heartlands of Africa will depend on a vaccine and better drugs and insecticides. Insect control is an essential part of reducing transmission. To date, two operational scale interventions, indoor residual spraying and deployment of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), are effective at reducing transmission. Our ability to monitor and evaluate these interventions needs to be improved so that scarce resources can be sensibly deployed, and new interventions that reduce transmission in a cost-effective and efficient manner need to be developed. New interventions could include using transgenic mosquitoes, larviciding in urban areas, or utilizing cost-effective consumer products. Alongside this innovative development agenda, the potential negative impact of insecticide resistance, particularly on LLINs, for which only pyrethroids are available, needs to be monitored.},

Nevertheless, pesticide use is still a controversial issue and is at the regulatory forefront in most countries. The older generation of insecticide groups has been largely replaced by a plethora of novel molecules that exhibit improved human and environmental safety profiles. However, the use of such compounds is guided by their short-term efficacy; the indirect and subtler effects on their target species, namely arthropod pest species, have been neglected. Curiously, comprehensive risk assessments have increasingly explored effects on nontarget species, contrasting with the majority of efforts focused on the target arthropod pest species. The present review mitigates this shortcoming by hierarchically exploring within an ecotoxicology framework applied to integrated pest management the myriad effects of insecticide use on arthropod pest species.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance mutations are widely assumed to carry fitness costs. However studies to measure such costs are rarely performed on genetically related strains and are often only done in the laboratory. Theory also suggests that once evolved the cost of resistance can be offset by the evolution of fitness modifiers. But for insecticide resistance only one such example is well documented. Here we critically examine the literature on fitness costs in the absence of pesticide and ask if our knowledge of molecular biology has helped us predict the costs associated with different resistance mechanisms. We find that resistance alleles can arise from pre-existing polymorphisms and resistance associated variation can also be maintained by sexual antagonism. We describe novel mechanisms whereby both resistant and susceptible alleles can be maintained in permanent heterozygosis and discuss the likely consequences for fitness both in the presence and absence of pesticide. Taken together these findings suggest that we cannot assume that resistance always appears de novo and that our assumptions about the associated fitness costs need to be informed by a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular biology.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance is a broadly recognized ecological backlash resulting from insecticide use and iswidely reported among arthropod pest species with well-recognized underlying mechanisms and consequences. Nonetheless, insecticide resistance is the subject of evolving conceptual views that introduces a different concept useful if recognized in its own right – the risk or likelihood of control failure. Here we suggest an experimental approach to assess the likelihood of control failure of an insecticide allowing for consistent decision-making regarding management of insecticide resistance. We also challenge the current emphasis on limited spatial sampling of arthropod populations for resistance diagnosis in favor of comprehensive spatial sampling. This necessarily requires largerpopulation sampling – aiming touse spatial analysis inarea-wide surveys – to recognize focalpointsof insecticide resistance and/or control failure that will better directmanagementefforts. The continuous geographical scale of such surveys will depend on the arthropod pest species, the pattern of insecticide use and many other potential factors. Regardless, distance dependence among sampling sites should still hold, following themaxim that the closer two things are, themore they resemble each other,which is the basis of Tobler's First LawofGeography. {\textcopyright}2016},

ABSTRACT Dominance has been assessed in different ways in insecticide resistance studies, based on three phenotypic traits: the insecticide concentration required to give a particular mortality (D LC), mortality at a particular insecticide dose (D ML), and Þtness in treated areas (D WT). We propose a general formula for estimating dominance on a scale of 0 to 1 (0 ϭ complete recessivity and 1 ϭ complete dominance). D LC , D ML , and D WT are not directly related and their values depend on genetic background and environmental conditions. We also show that pest management strategies can have the consequence to increase D WT via the selection of dominance modiÞers. Studies on resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins provide the ultimate example of the complexity of the deÞnition of the concept of dominance. Almost all studies have focused on calculation of D LC , which provides little information about the efÞciency of pest management programs. For instance, one assumption of the high dose/refuge strategy is that Bacillus thuringiensis resistance must be effec-tively recessive (i.e., D ML must be close to zero). However, D WT , rather than D ML , is relevant to the resistance management strategy. Therefore, we strongly suggest that the time has come to focus on Þtness dominance levels in the presence and absence of insecticide.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance raises concerns for the control of vector-borne diseases. However, its impact on parasite transmission could be diverse when considering the ecological interactions between vector and parasite. Thus we investigated the fitness cost associated with insecticide resistance and Plasmodium falciparum infection as well as their interactive cost on Anopheles gambiae survival and fecundity. In absence of infection, we observed a cost on fecundity associated with insecticide resistance. However, survival was higher for mosquito bearing the kdr mutation and equal for those with the ace-1(R) mutation compared to their insecticide susceptible counterparts. Interestingly, Plasmodium infection reduced survival only in the insecticide resistant strains but not in the susceptible one and infection was associated with an increase in fecundity independently of the strain considered. This study provides evidence for a survival cost associated with infection by Plasmodium parasite only in mosquito selected for insecticide resistance. This suggests that the selection of insecticide resistance mutation may have disturbed the interaction between parasites and vectors, resulting in increased cost of infection. Considering the fitness cost as well as other ecological aspects of this natural mosquito-parasite combination is important to predict the epidemiological impact of insecticide resistance.},

More recently, with the advent of annotated insect genomes, resistance mediated by complex multi-gene enzyme systems such as esterases, cytochrome P450s and glutathione-S-transferases has also been elucidated. In this article, we review the impact of Drosophila genetics on the field of insect resistance and focus on the current and future impact of genomics.

Vector control using insecticides coupled with larval source reduction is critical to control the transmission of these viruses to humans but is threatened by the emergence of insecticide resistance. Here, we review the available evidence for the geographical distribution of insecticide resistance in these 2 major vectors worldwide and map the data collated for the 4 main classes of neurotoxic insecticide (carbamates, organochlorines, organophosphates, and pyrethroids). Emerging resistance to all 4 of these insecticide classes has been detected in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Target-site mutations and increased insecticide detoxification have both been linked to resistance in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus but more work is required to further elucidate metabolic mechanisms and develop robust diagnostic assays. Geographical distributions are provided for the mechanisms that have been shown to be important to date. Estimating insecticide resistance in unsampled locations is hampered by a lack of standardisation in the diagnostic tools used and by a lack of data in a number of regions for both resistance phenotypes and genotypes. The need for increased sampling using standard methods is critical to tackle the issue of emerging insecticide resistance threatening human health. Specifically, diagnostic doses and well-characterised susceptible strains are needed for the full range of insecticides used to control Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to standardise measurement of the resistant phenotype, and calibrated diagnostic assays are needed for the major mechanisms of resistance.},

While at first the field was split by arguments about the relative importance of mono- vs. polygenic resistance and field- vs. laboratory-based selection, the application of molecular cloning to insecticide targets and to the metabolic enzymes that degrade insecticides before they reach those targets has brought out an exponential growth in our understanding of the mutations involved. Molecular analysis has confirmed the relative importance of single major genes in target-site resistance and has also revealed some interesting surprises about the multi-gene families, such as cytochrome P450s, involved in metabolic resistance. Identification of the mutations involved in resistance has also led to parallel advances in our understanding of the enzymes and receptors involved, often with implications for the role of these receptors in humans. This Review seeks to provide an historical perspective on the impact of molecular biology on our understanding of resistance and to begin to look forward to the likely impact of rapid advances in both sequencing and genome-wide association analysis.},

abstract = {Mutations of esterase 3 confer two forms of organophosphate resistance on contemporary Australasian Lucilia cuprina. One form, called diazinon resistance, is slightly more effective against commonly used insecticides and is now more prevalent than the other form, called malathion resistance. We report here that the single amino acid replacement associated with diazinon resistance and two replacements associated with malathion resistance also occur in esterase 3 in the sibling species Lucilia sericata, suggesting convergent evolution around a finite set of resistance options. We also find parallels between the species in the geographic distributions of the polymorphisms: In both cases, the diazinon-resistance change is absent or rare outside Australasia where insecticide pressure is lower, whereas the changes associated with malathion resistance are widespread. Furthermore, PCR analysis of pinned specimens of Australasian L. cuprina collected before the release of organophosphate insecticides reveals no cases of the diazinon-resistance change but several cases of those associated with malathion resistance. Thus, the early outbreak of resistance in this species can be explained by the preexistence of mutant alleles encoding malathion resistance. The pinned specimen analysis also shows much higher genetic diversity at the locus before organophosphate use, suggesting that the subsequent sweep of diazinon resistance in Australasia has compromised the scope for the locus to respond further to the ongoing challenge of the insecticides.},

abstract = {Many of the most dangerous human diseases are transmitted by insect vectors. After decades of repeated insecticide use, all of these vector species have demonstrated the capacity to evolve resistance to insecticides. Insecticide resistance is generally considered to undermine control of vector-transmitted diseases because it increases the number of vectors that survive the insecticide treatment. Disease control failure, however, need not follow from vector control failure. Here, we review evidence that insecticide resistance may have an impact on the quality of vectors and, specifically, on three key determinants of parasite transmission: vector longevity, competence, and behaviour. We argue that, in some instances, insecticide resistance is likely to result in a decrease in vector longevity, a decrease in infectiousness, or in a change in behaviour, all of which will reduce the vectorial capacity of the insect. If this effect is sufficiently large, the impact of insecticide resistance on disease management may not be as detrimental as previously thought. In other instances, however, insecticide resistance may have the opposite effect, increasing the insect's vectorial capacity, which may lead to a dramatic increase in the transmission of the disease and even to a higher prevalence than in the absence of insecticides. Either way-and there may be no simple generality-the consequence of the evolution of insecticide resistance for disease ecology deserves additional attention.},

abstract = {The search for highly effective anti-malarial therapies has gathered pace and recent years have seen a number of promising single and combined therapies reach the late stages of development. A key drug development challenge is the need for early assessment of the clinical utility of new drug leads as it is often unclear for developers whether efforts should be focused on efficacy or metabolic stability/exposure or indeed whether the continuation of iterative QSAR (quantitative structure–activity and relationships) cycles of medicinal chemistry and biological testing will translate to improved clinical efficacy. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)-based measurements available from in vitro studies can be used for such clinical predictions. However, these predictions often require bespoke mathematical PK/PD modelling expertise and are normally performed after candidate development and, therefore, not during the pre-clinical development phase when such decisions need to be made. An internet-based tool has been developed using STELLA{\textregistered} software. The tool simulates multiple differential equations that describe anti-malarial PK/PD relationships where the user can easily input PK/PD parameters. The tool utilizes a simple stop-light system to indicate the efficacy of each combination of parameters. This tool, called OptiMal-PK, additionally allows for the investigation of the effect of drug combinations with known or custom compounds. The results of simulations obtained from OptiMal-PK were compared to a previously published and validated mathematical model on which this tool is based. The tool has also been used to simulate the PK/PD relationship for a number of existing anti-malarial drugs in single or combined treatment. Simulations were predictive of the published clinical parasitological clearance activities for these existing therapies. OptiMal-PK is designed to be implemented by medicinal chemists and pharmacologists during the pre-clinical anti-malarial drug development phase to explore the impact of different PK/PD parameters upon the predicted clinical activity of any new compound. It can help investigators to identify which pharmacological features of a compound are most important to the clinical performance of a new chemical entity and how partner drugs could potentially improve the activity of existing therapies.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance in mosquito populations threatens recent successes in malaria prevention. Elucidating patterns of genetic structure in malaria vectors to predict the speed and direction of the spread of resistance is essential to get ahead of the ‘resistance curve' and to avert a public health catastrophe. Here, applying a combination of microsatellite analysis, whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing of a resistance locus, we elucidated the continent-wide population structure of a major African malaria vector, Anopheles funestus. We identified a major selective sweep in a genomic region controlling cytochrome P450-based metabolic resistance conferring high resistance to pyrethroids. This selective sweep occurred since 2002, likely as a direct consequence of scaled up vector control as revealed by whole genome and fine-scale sequencing of pre- and post-intervention populations. Fine-scaled analysis of the pyrethroid resistance locus revealed that a resistance-associated allele of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP6P9a has swept through southern Africa to near fixation, in contrast to high polymorphism levels before interventions, conferring high levels of pyrethroid resistance linked to control failure. Population structure analysis revealed a barrier to gene flow between southern Africa and other areas, which may prevent or slow the spread of the southern mechanism of pyrethroid resistance to other regions. By identifying a genetic signature of pyrethroid-based interventions, we have demonstrated the intense selective pressure that control interventions exert on mosquito populations. If this level of selection and spread of resistance continues unabated, our ability to control malaria with current interventions will be compromised.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Significant reductions in malaria transmission have been achieved over the last 15 years with elimination occurring in a small number of countries, however, increasing drug and insecticide resistance threatens these gains. Insecticide resistance has decreased the observed mortality to the most commonly used insecticide class, the pyrethroids, and the number of alternative classes approved for use in public health is limited. Disease prevention and elimination relies on operational control of Anopheles malaria vectors, which requires the deployment of effective insecticides. Resistance is a rapidly evolving phenomena and the resources and human capacity to continuously monitor vast numbers of mosquito populations in numerous locations simultaneously are not available. Resistance data are obtained from published articles, by contacting authors and custodians of unpublished data sets. Where possible data is disaggregated to single sites and collection periods to give a fine spatial resolution. Currently the data set includes data from 1955 to October 2016 from 71 malaria endemic countries and 74 anopheline species. This includes data for all four classes of insecticides and associated resistance mechanisms. Resistance is a rapidly evolving phenomena and the resources and human capacity to continuously monitor vast numbers of mosquito populations in numerous locations simultaneously are not available. The Malaria Atlas Project-Insecticide Resistance (MAP-IR) venture has been established to develop tools that will use available data to provide best estimates of the spatial distribution of insecticide resistance and help guide control programmes on this serious issue.},

Nevertheless, it is often unclear what fitness actually is, and its meaning often depends on the context. Here we argue that fitness should not be a basal ingredient in verbal or mathematical descriptions of evolution. Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on a number of central issues in evolution.},

abstract = {The sustainability of malaria control in Africa is threatened by rising levels of insecticide resistance, and new tools to prevent malaria transmission are urgently needed. To gain a better understanding of the mosquito populations that transmit malaria, we sequenced the genomes of 765 wild specimens of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii sampled from 15 locations across Africa. The data reveal high levels of genetic diversity, with over 50 million single nucleotide polymorphisms across the 230 Mbp genome. We observe complex patterns of population structure and marked variations in local population size, some of which may be due at least in part to malaria control interventions. Insecticide resistance genes show strong signatures of recent selection associated with multiple independent mutations spreading over large geographical distances and between species. The genetic variability of natural populations substantially reduces the target space for novel gene-drive strategies for mosquito control. This large dataset provides a foundation for tracking the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance and developing new vector control tools.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of insecticide treated nets is under threat across Africa south of the Sahara from the selection of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. To maintain progress against malaria it is necessary to identify alternative residual insecticides for mosquito nets. Mixtures of pyrethroid and insecticides with novel mode of action provide scope for both improved control and management of resistance through concurrent exposure to unrelated insecticides.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The pyrrole chlorfenapyr and the pyrethroid alphacypermethrin were tested individually and as a mixture on mosquito nets in an experimental hut trial in southern Benin against pyrethroid resistant An gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. The nets were deliberately holed to simulate the effect of wear and tear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The nets treated with the mixture of chlorfenapyr 200 mg/m² and alphacypermethrin 25 mg/m² killed a proportion of An gambiae (77{\%}, 95{\%}CI: 66-86{\%}) significantly greater than nets treated with alphacypermethrin 25 mg/m(2) (30{\%}, 95{\%}CI: 21-41{\%}) but not significantly different from nets treated with chlorfenapyr 200 mg/m² (69{\%}, 95{\%}CI: 57-78{\%}). The nets treated with the mixtures procured personal protection against An gambiae biting(58-62{\%}) by a greater margin than the alphacypermethrin treated net (39{\%}), whereas the chlorfenapyr treated net was not protective. A similar trend in mortality and blood feeding inhibition between treatments was observed in Cx quinquefasciatus to that seen in An. gambiae, although the effects were lower. A mixture of alphacypermethrin with chlorfenapyr applied at 100 mg/m² had an effect similar to the mixture with chlorfenapyr at 200 mg/m².$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The effectiveness of ITNs against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes was restored by the mixture: the alphacypermethrin component reduced human-vector contact while the chlorfenapyr controlled pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. The complementary action of these unrelated insecticides demonstrates that the combination on nets has potential for preventing malaria transmission in areas compromised by the spread of pyrethroid resistance.},

The approach used most widely to delay insect resistance to Bt crops is the refuge strategy, which requires refuges of host plants without Bt toxins near Bt crops to promote survival of susceptible pests. However, large-scale tests of the refuge strategy have been problematic. Analysis of more than a decade of global monitoring data reveals that the frequency of resistance alleles has increased substantially in some field populations of Helicoverpa zea, but not in five other major pests in Australia, China, Spain and the United States. The resistance of H. zea to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in transgenic cotton has not caused widespread crop failures, in part because other tactics augment control of this pest. The field outcomes documented with monitoring data are consistent with the theory underlying the refuge strategy, suggesting that refuges have helped to delay resistance.},

abstract = {This chapter highlights the diversity of mechanisms for both pesticidal activity and selectivity. Pesticides are intended to disrupt a primary target in the pest so it is no longer harmful. The pesticide per se or as its bioactivated form binds to or interacts with a specific enzyme, receptor, protein, or membrane, initiating a series of events that is deleterious or lethal to the pest. The primary interaction usually occurs with the pesticide at picomolar or nanomolar levels and secondary interactions at higher concentrations. However, this is not always the case. There may be several targets of similar sensitivity but not equal importance. The discovery of each new type of pesticide is followed by structural optimization for the highest possible potency involving sequential modification of each substituent to best fit the target site. Most insecticides by number, amount, and market value act on the nervous system at the synapse or the axon. The cholinergic system is the principal insecticide target with OP and MC compounds inhibiting AChE to prolong the excitatory action of acetylcholine. Pesticide management is a major aspect of pest control. However, we can still achieve higher target site potency and lower use levels, reduced environmental impact, and improved safety. Pesticide legislation policies for risks and hazards continue a trend toward ever-greater restrictions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Theoretical models suggest that plants containing two dissimilar Bt toxin genes ('pyramided' plants) have the potential to delay resistance more effectively than single-toxin plants used sequentially or in mosaics. To test these predictions, we developed a unique model system consisting of Bt transgenic broccoli plants and the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. We conducted a greenhouse study using an artificial population of diamondback moths carrying genes for resistance to the Bt toxins Cry1Ac and Cry1C at frequencies of about 0.10 and 0.20, respectively. After 24 generations of selection, resistance to pyramided two-gene plants was significantly delayed as compared with resistance to single-gene plants deployed in mosaics, and to Cry1Ac toxin when it was the first used in a sequence. These results have important implications for the development and regulation of transgenic insecticidal plants.},

abstract = {Since the year 2000, a concerted campaign against malaria has led to unprecedented levels of intervention coverage across sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the effect of this control effort is vital to inform future control planning. However, the effect of malaria interventions across the varied epidemiological settings of Africa remains poorly understood owing to the absence of reliable surveillance data and the simplistic approaches underlying current disease estimates. Here we link a large database of malaria field surveys with detailed reconstructions of changing intervention coverage to directly evaluate trends from 2000 to 2015, and quantify the attributable effect of malaria disease control efforts. We found that Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40{\%} between 2000 and 2015. We estimate that interventions have averted 663 (542-753 credible interval) million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor (68{\%} of cases averted). Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Increasing access to these interventions, and maintaining their effectiveness in the face of insecticide and drug resistance, should form a cornerstone of post-2015 control strategies.},

The generally recognized approaches to r{\'{e}}sistance management are grouped underthree principal cat{\'{e}}gories: first, low s{\'{e}}lection pressure, supplemented by a strong component of non-chemical measures (management by mod{\'{e}}ration); second, {\'{e}}limination of the s{\'{e}}lective advantage of r{\'{e}}sistant individuals by increasing insecticide uptake through the use of attractants, or by suppressing of detoxication enzymes through the use of synergists (management by saturation); and third, application of multi-directional s{\'{e}}lection by means of mixtures or rotations of unrelated insecticides or by use of chemicals with multi-site action (management by multiple attack). Th{\`{e}}se approaches are not mutually exclusive and {\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ments from each can be used to formulate a season-long management program. The strategy chosen must be based on a thorough knowledge of the r{\'{e}}sistance implications of the candidate insecticides and of the biology and ecology of the species concerned, and must make use of ail available non-chemical control measures.},

abstract = {Transgenic insect-resistant crops that express toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) offer significant advantages to pest management, but are at risk of losing these advantages to the evolution of resistance in the targeted insect pests. All commercially available cultivars of these crops carry only a single Bt gene, and are particularly at risk where the targeted insect pests are not highly sensitive to the Bt toxin used. Under such circumstances, the most prudent method of avoiding resistance is to ensure that a large proportion of the pest population develops on non-transgenic 'refuge' hosts, generally of the crop itself. This has generated recommendations that 20{\%} or more of the cotton and maize in any given area should be non-transgenic. This may be costly in terms of yields and may encourage further reliance on and resistance to pesticides. The use of two or more toxins in the same variety (pyramiding) can reduce the amount of refuge required to delay resistance for an extended period. Cross-resistance among the toxins appears to have been overestimated as a potential risk to the use of pyramids (and pesticide mixtures) because cross-resistance is at least as important when toxicants are used independently. Far more critical is that there should be nearly 100{\%} mortality of susceptible insects on the transgenic crops. The past failures of pesticide mixtures to manage resistance provide important lessons for the most efficacious deployment of multiple toxins in transgenic crops.},

abstract = {Transgenic crops producing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins for insect control have been successful, but their efficacy is reduced when pests evolve resistance. To delay pest resistance to Bt crops, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required refuges of host plants that do not produce Bt toxins to promote survival of susceptible pests. Such refuges are expected to be most effective if the Bt plants deliver a dose of toxin high enough to kill nearly all hybrid progeny produced by matings between resistant and susceptible pests. In 2003, the EPA first registered corn, Zea mays L., producing a Bt toxin (Cry3Bb1) that kills western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, one of the most economically important crop pests in the United States. The EPA requires minimum refuges of 20{\%} for Cry3Bb1 corn and 5{\%} for corn producing two Bt toxins active against corn rootworms. We conclude that the current refuge requirements are not adequate, because Bt corn hybrids active against corn rootworms do not meet the high-dose standard, and western corn rootworm has rapidly evolved resistance to Cry3Bb1 corn in the laboratory, greenhouse, and field. Accordingly, we recommend increasing the minimum refuge for Bt corn targeting corn rootworms to 50{\%} for plants producing one toxin active against these pests and to 20{\%} for plants producing two toxins active against these pests. Increasing the minimum refuge percentage can help to delay pest resistance, encourage integrated pest management, and promote more sustainable crop protection.},

abstract = {Crops engineered to produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium . Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) provide an effective management tool for many key insect pests. However, pest species have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to adapt to management practices. Results from laboratory selection experiments illustrate the capacity of pest species to evolve Bt resistance. Furthermore, resistance has been documented to Bt sprays in the field and greenhouse, and more recently, by some pests to Bt crops in the field. In 2009, fields were discovered in Iowa (USA) with populations of western corn rootworm, . Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, that had evolved resistance to maize that produces the Bt toxin Cry3Bb1. Fields with resistant insects in 2009 had been planted to Cry3Bb1 maize for at least three consecutive years and as many as 6. years. Computer simulation models predicted that the western corn rootworm might evolve resistance to Bt maize in as few as 3. years. Laboratory and field data for interactions between western corn rootworm and Bt maize indicate that currently commercialized products are not high-dose events, which increases the risk of resistance evolution because non-recessive resistance traits may enhance survival on Bt maize. Furthermore, genetic analysis of laboratory strains of western corn rootworm has found non-recessive inheritance of resistance. Field studies conducted in two fields identified as harboring Cry3Bb1-resistant western corn rootworm found that survival of western corn rootworm did not differ between Cry3Bb1 maize and non-Bt maize and that root injury to Cry3Bb1 maize was higher than injury to other types of Bt maize or to maize roots protected with a soil insecticide. These first cases of field-evolved resistance to Bt maize by western corn rootworm provide an early warning and point to the need to apply better integrated pest management practices when using Bt maize to manage western corn rootworm. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

To assess the potential of pyramids to achieve this goal, we analyze data from 38 studies that report effects of ten Bt toxins used in transgenic crops against 15 insect pests. We find that compared with optimal low levels of insect survival, survival on currently used pyramids is often higher for both susceptible insects and insects resistant to one of the toxins in the pyramid. Furthermore, we find that cross-resistance and antagonism between toxins used in pyramids are common, and that these problems are associated with the similarity of the amino acid sequences of domains II and III of the toxins, respectively. This analysis should assist in future pyramid design and the development of sustainable resistance management strategies.},

abstract = {A simulation model of the population dynamics and genetics of western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), was created to evaluate the use of refuges in the management of resistance to transgenic insecticidal corn, Zea mays L., expressing one or two toxin traits. Hypothetical scenarios and a case study of a corn hybrid pyramided with existing toxins are simulated. In the hypothetical situations, results demonstrated that evolution is generally delayed by pyramids compared with deployment of a single-toxin corn hybrid. However, soil insecticide use in the refuge reduced this delay and quickened the evolution of resistance. Results were sensitive to the degree of male beetle dispersal before mating and to the effectiveness of both toxins in the pyramid. Resistance evolved faster as fecundity increased for survivors of insecticidal corn. Thus, effects on fecundity must be measured to predict which resistance management plans will work well. Evolution of resistance also occurred faster if the survival rate due to exposure to the two toxins was not calculated by multiplication of two independent survival rates (one for each insect gene) but was equivalent to the minimum of the two. Furthermore, when single-trait and pyramided corn hybrids were planted within rootworm-dispersal distance of each other, the toxin traits lost efficacy more quickly than they did in scenarios without single-trait corn. For the case study involving transgenic corn expressing Cry34/35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1, the pyramid delayed evolution longer than a single trait corn hybrid and longer than a sequence of toxins based on at least one resistance-allele frequency remaining below 50{\%}. Results are discussed within the context of a changing transgenic corn marketplace and the landscape dynamics of resistance management.},

Yields for Bt maize plots were significantly greater than for non-Bt maize; however, insecticides did not significantly affect yield. Insecticides significantly decreased root injury in non-Bt maize plots, but there were no significant differences in root injury between Bt maize with or without either insecticide. Maize producing the Bt toxin Cry3Bb1 and the soil-applied insecticide Aztec significantly decreased survival of western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte), while only Bt maize significantly decreased survival of the northern corn rootworm (Diabrotica barberi Smith {\&} Lawrence). For both species, Bt maize and each of the insecticides delayed emergence. In the absence of density-dependent mortality, Bt maize imposed 71 and 80{\%} reduction in survival on the western corn rootworm and the northern corn rootworm, respectively. The data from this study do not support combining insecticide with Bt maize because the addition of insecticide did not increase yield or reduce root injury for Bt maize, and the level of rootworm mortality achieved with conventional insecticide was likely too low to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. In addition, delays in emergence from Bt maize combined with insecticides could promote assortative mating among Bt-selected individuals, which may hasten resistance evolution.},

Vector control is a very important part of the global strategy for management of mosquito-associated diseases, and insecticide application is the most important component in this effort. However, mosquito-borne diseases are now resurgent, largely because of the insecticide resistance that has developed in mosquito vectors and the drug resistance of pathogens. A large number of studies have shown that multiple, complex resistance mechanisms—in particular, increased metabolic detoxification of insecticides and decreased sensitivity of the target proteins—or genes are likely responsible for insecticide resistance. Gene overexpression and amplification, and mutations in protein-coding-gene regions, have frequently been implicated as well.

Every effort should be made to find methods of responding to, or preventing, the emergence of pyrethroid resistance in the Anopheles vectors. Some cases of such resistance are known, notably in An. gambiae in West Africa where the kdr type of resistance has been selected, probably because of the use of pyrethroids on cotton. Because pyrethroids are irritant to mosquitoes, laboratory studies on the impact of, and selection for, resistance need to be conducted with free-flying mosquitoes in conditions that are as realistic as possible. Such studies are beginning to suggest that, although there is cross-resistance to all pyrethroids, some treatments are less likely to select for resistance than others are. Organophosphate, carbamate and phenyl pyrazole insecticides have been tested as alternative treatments for nets or curtains. Attempts have been made to mix an insect growth regulator and a pyrethroid on netting to sterilize pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes that are not killed after contact with the netting. There seems to be no easy solution to the problem of pyrethroid resistance management, but further research is urgently needed.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance is the selection of a heritable trait in an insect population that results in an insect control product no longer performing as intended. Insecticides remain the mainstay of many tropical disease control programmes; therefore, the potential for such programmes to be compromised by insecticide resistance is of major concern. Although efforts are under way to develop new insect control products that will effectively control insect strains resistant to currently used insecticides, the need to protect and extend the useful life of current insecticides will remain. For this reason, resistance management must be given a higher priority in the decision making process in vector control programmes than is currently the case.},

abstract = {Sequences, mixtures, rotations, and mosaics are potential strategies for using more than one pesticide to manage pest populations and for slowing the evolution of pesticide resistance. Results from theoretical models suggest that, under certain conditions, mixtures might be especially effective for resistance management. The assumptions of such models, however, are probably not widely applicable. Potential disadvantages associated with mixtures that are usually not considered in modeling studies include disruption of biological control, promotion of resistance in secondary pests, and intense selection for cross-resistance. Results from limited experimental work suggest that pesticide combinations do not consistently suppress resistance development. More thorough evaluation of tactics that seek to optimize benefits of more than one insecticide will require rigorous experiments with the particular pest and pesticide combinations. Because of the difficulty in generalizing results across systems and the potential negative effects of multiple insecticide use, emphasis on minimizing insecticide use is recommended.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance has the potential to compromise the enormous effort put into the control of dengue and malaria vector populations. It is therefore important to quantify the amount of selection acting on resistance alleles, their contributions to fitness in heterozygotes (dominance) and their initial frequencies, as a means to predict the rate of spread of resistance in natural populations. We investigate practical problems of obtaining such estimates, with particular emphasis on Mexican populations of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Selection and dominance coefficients can be estimated by fitting genetic models to field data using maximum likelihood (ML) methodology. This methodology, although widely used, makes many assumptions so we investigated how well such models perform when data are sparse or when spatial and temporal heterogeneity occur. As expected, ML methodologies reliably estimated selection and dominance coefficients under idealised conditions but it was difficult to recover the true values when datasets were sparse during the time that resistance alleles increased in frequency, or when spatial and temporal heterogeneity occurred. We analysed published data on pyrethroid resistance in Mexico that consists of the frequency of a Ile1,016 mutation. The estimates for selection coefficient and initial allele frequency on the field dataset were in the expected range, dominance coefficient points to incomplete dominance as observed in the laboratory, although these estimates are accompanied by strong caveats about possible impact of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in selection.},

The oligomeric structure interacts then with a second GPI-anchored receptor that induces insertion into membrane microdomains and larvae death. In the case of mosquitocidal Bt strains, two different toxins participate, Cry and Cyt. These toxins have a synergistic effect and Cyt1Aa overcomes Cry toxin-resistance.

Insecticide resistance has decreased the efficacy of the most commonly used insecticide class of pyrethroids. This decreased efficacy has increased mosquito survival, which is a prelude to rising incidence of malaria and fatalities. Despite intensive research efforts, new insecticides will not reach the market for at least 5 years. Elimination of malaria is not possible without effective mosquito control. Therefore, to combat the threat of resistance, key stakeholders need to rapidly embrace a multifaceted approach including a reduction in the cost of bringing new resistance management methods to market and the streamlining of associated development, policy, and implementation pathways to counter this looming public health catastrophe.},

abstract = {proven methods of controlling malaria, but mosquitoes can rapidly evolve resistance. Such evolution, first seen in the 1950s in areas of widespread DDT use, is a major challenge because attempts to comprehensively control and even eliminate malaria rely heavily on indoor house spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets. Current strategies for dealing with resistance evolution are expensive and open ended, and their sustainability has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show that if insecticides targeted old mosquitoes, and ideally old malaria-infected mosquitoes, they could provide effective malaria control while only weakly selecting for resistance. This alone would greatly enhance the useful life span of an insecticide. However, such weak selection for resistance can easily be overwhelmed if resistance is associated with fitness costs. In that case, late-life-acting insecticides would never be undermined by mosquito evolution. We discuss a number of practical ways to achieve this, including different use of existing chemical insecticides, biopesticides, and novel chemistry. Done right, a one-off investment in a single insecticide would solve the problem of mosquito resistance forever.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The evolution of insecticide-resistance in malaria vectors is emerging as a serious challenge for the control of malaria. Modelling the spread of insecticide-resistance is an essential tool to understand the evolutionary pressures and dynamics caused by the application of insecticides. METHODOLOGY: We developed a population-genetic model of the spread of insecticide-resistance in a population of Anopheles vectors in response to insecticides used either as adulticides (focussing on insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)) or as larvicides (either for the control of malaria or, as an inadvertent side-product, in agriculture). RESULTS: We show that indoor use of insecticides leads to considerably less selection pressure than their use as larvicides, supporting the idea that most resistance of malaria vectors is due to the agricultural use of the insecticides that are also used for malaria control. The reasons for the relatively low selection pressure posed by adulticides are (i) that males are not affected by the ITNs and, in particular, (ii) that the insecticides are also repellents, keeping mosquitoes at bay from contacting the insecticide but also driving them to bite either people who do not use the insecticide or alternative hosts. CONCLUSION: We conclude by discussing the opposing public health benefits of high repellency at an epidemiological and an evolutionary timescale: whereas repellency is beneficial to delay the evolution of resistance, other models have shown that it decreases the population-level protection of the insecticide.},

Justifiting the first two choices usually requires little more than data on product persistence in terms of toxic effect on susceptible individuals under field conditions. The last tactic requires additional information on resistance ratios for resistant and susceptible genotypes under jeld exposure. The efficacy of pesticide mixtures is highly dependent on equal persistence of both compounds used in the mixture.

The Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Management in malaria vectors (GPIRM), released in May 2012, is a collective strategy for the malaria community to tackle this challenge. This review outlines progress made to date and the challenges experienced in the implementation of GPIRM, and outlines focus areas requiring urgent attention. Whilst there has been some advancement, uptake of GPIRM at the national level has generally been poor for various reasons, including limited availability of vector control tools with new mechanisms of action as well as critical financial, human and infrastructural resource deficiencies. There is an urgent need for a global response plan to address these deficits and ensure the correct and efficient use of available tools in order to maintain the effectiveness of current vector control efforts whilst novel vector control tools are under development. Emphasis must be placed on enhancing national capacities (such as human and infrastructural resources) to enable efficient monitoring and management of insecticide resistance, and to support availability and accessibility of appropriate new vector control products. Lack of action by the global community to address the threat of insecticide resistance is unacceptable and deprives affected communities of their basic right of universal access to effective malaria prevention. Aligning efforts and assigning the needed resources will ensure the optimal implementation of GPIRM with the ultimate goal of maintaining effective malaria vector control.},

However, it remains unclear what overall reduction in transmission is achievable using currently available tools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed an individual-based simulation model for Plasmodium falciparum transmission in an African context incorporating the three major vector species (Anopheles gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis, and An. funestus) with parameters obtained by fitting to parasite prevalence data from 34 transmission settings across Africa. We incorporated the effect of the switch to artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) and increasing coverage of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) from the year 2000 onwards. We then explored the impact on transmission of continued roll-out of LLINs, additional rounds of indoor residual spraying (IRS), mass screening and treatment (MSAT), and a future RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in six representative settings with varying transmission intensity (as summarized by the annual entomological inoculation rate, EIR: 1 setting with low, 3 with moderate, and 2 with high EIRs), vector-species combinations, and patterns of seasonality. In all settings we considered a realistic target of 80{\%} coverage of interventions. In the low-transmission setting (EIR approximately 3 ibppy [infectious bites per person per year]), LLINs have the potential to reduce malaria transmission to low levels ({\textless}1{\%} parasite prevalence in all age-groups) provided usage levels are high and sustained. In two of the moderate-transmission settings (EIR approximately 43 and 81 ibppy), additional rounds of IRS with DDT coupled with MSAT could drive parasite prevalence below a 1{\%} threshold. However, in the third (EIR = 46) with An. arabiensis prevailing, these interventions are insufficient to reach this threshold. In both high-transmission settings (EIR approximately 586 and 675 ibppy), either unrealistically high coverage levels ({\textgreater}90{\%}) or novel tools and/or substantial social improvements will be required, although considerable reductions in prevalence can be achieved with existing tools and realistic coverage levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Interventions using current tools can result in major reductions in P. falciparum malaria transmission and the associated disease burden in Africa. Reduction to the 1{\%} parasite prevalence threshold is possible in low- to moderate-transmission settings when vectors are primarily endophilic (indoor-resting), provided a comprehensive and sustained intervention program is achieved through roll-out of interventions. In high-transmission settings and those in which vectors are mainly exophilic (outdoor-resting), additional new tools that target exophagic (outdoor-biting), exophilic, and partly zoophagic mosquitoes will be required.},

New bednets provide substantial personal protection until high levels of resistance though protection may wane faster against more resistant mosquito populations as nets age. Transmission dynamics models indicate that even low levels of resistance would increase the incidence of malaria due to reduced mosquito mortality and lower overall community protection over the life-time of the net.

abstract = {Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) have become a central tool for malaria control because they provide personal and community-wide protection through their repellent and insecticidal properties. Here we propose a model that allows to assess the relative importance of those two effects in different epidemiological contexts and we show that these two levels of protection may oppose each other. On the one hand, repellency offers personal protection to the users of ITNs. The repellent action, however, is a two-edged sword, for it diverts infectious mosquitoes to non-users, thereby increasing their risk. Furthermore, with increasing ITN coverage, the personal protection effect of repellency decreases as mosquitoes are forced to perform multiple feeding attempts even on ITN users. On the other hand, the insecticidal property, which offers community-wide protection by killing mosquitoes, requires that mosquitoes contact the insecticide on the ITN and is thus counteracted by the repellency. Our model confirms that ITNs are an effective intervention method by reducing total malaria prevalence in the population, but that there is a conflict between personal protection, offered by repellency, and community-wide protection, which relies on the ITN's insecticidal properties. Crucially, the model suggests that weak repellency allows disease elimination at lower ITN coverage levels.},
